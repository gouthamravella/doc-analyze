 ï»¿tech blockchain technology work guide beginner nearly everyone heard blockchain cool everybody understands work article show blockchain certainly isnt magic blockchain blockchain diary almost impossible forge hash function let imagine people one room decided make separate currency follow flow fund one person let call bob decided keep list action diary one man let call jack decided steal money hide this changed entry diary bob noticed someone interfered diary decided stop happening found program called hash function turn text set number letter table below hash string number letter produced hash function hash function mathematical function take variable number character convert string fixed number character even small change string creates completely new hash record inserted hash new diary follows jack decided change entry again night got diary changed record generated new hash bob noticed somebody sifted diary again decided complicate record transaction record inserted hash generated recordlast hash entry depends previous jack try change record change hash previous entry jack really wanted money spent whole night counting hash nonce bob want give up decided add number record number called nonce nonce chosen generated hash end two zero now forge record jack would spend hour hour chosing nonce line importantly people computer cant figure nonce quickly node later bob realized many record couldnt keep diary like forever wrote transaction converted one page spreadsheet mary checked transaction right bob spread spreadsheet diary computer world computer called node every time transaction occurs approved node check validity every node checked transaction sort electronic vote node may think transaction valid others think fraud node referred computer node copy digital ledger blockchain node check validity transaction majority node say transaction valid written block now jack change one entry computer original hash would allow change occur block one spreadsheet called block the whole family block blockchain every node copy blockchain block reach certain number approved transaction new block formed blockchain update every ten minute automatically master central computer instructs computer this soon spreadsheet ledger registry updated longer changed thus impossible forge it add new entry it registry updated computer network time important point blockchain type diary spreadsheet containing information transaction transaction generates hash hash string number letter transaction entered order occurred order important hash depends transaction previous transaction hash even small change transaction creates completely new hash node check make sure transaction changed inspecting hash transaction approved majority node written block block refers previous block together make blockchain blockchain effective spread many computer copy blockchain computer called node blockchain update every minute wallet digital signature protocol bob gathered people together needed explain new coin them jack confessed sin group deeply apologized prove sincerity gave ann mary coin back sorted bob explained could never happen again decided implement something called digital signature confirm every transaction first gave everyone wallet wallet wallet string number letter cecefb address appear various block within blockchain transaction take place visible record transaction who number wallet address particular wallet also public key read article bitcoin wallet everything need know digital signature carry transaction need two thing wallet basically address private key private key string random number unlike address private key must kept secret someone decides send coin anyone else must sign message containing transaction private key system two key heart encryption cryptography use long predates existence blockchain first proposed s message sent broadcast blockchain network network node work message make sure transaction contains valid confirms validity transaction placed block information changed tech blockchain work blockchain technology explained simple word follow jun credit anikadigitalvision vectorsgetty k blockchain technology probably best invention since internet itself allows value exchange without need trust central authority imagine bet tomorrow weather san francisco bet sunny rain today three option manage transaction trust other rainy sunny loser give winner friend could good way managing it however friend stranger one easily pay other turn bet contract contract place party prone pay however either two decide pay winner pay additional money cover legal expense court case might take long time especially small amount cash doesnt seem like optimal way manage transaction involve neutral third party u give third party give total amount winner hey could also run away money end one first two option trust contract neither trust contract optimal solution cant trust stranger enforcing contract requires time money blockchain technology interesting offer u third option secure quick cheap blockchain allows u write line code program running blockchain u send program keep safe check tomorrow weather automatically several data source sunny rainy automatically transfer whole amount winner party check contract logic running blockchain cant changed stopped may much effort bet imagine selling house company piece explains blockchain work without discussing technical detail depth digging enough give general idea underlying logic mechanism basic bitcoin image courtesy author known discussed application blockchain technology bitcoin digital currency used exchange product service like u dollar euro chinese yuan national currency let use first application blockchain technology learn work bitcoin give u first time way one internet user transfer unique piece digital property another internet user transfer guaranteed safe secure everyone know transfer taken place nobody challenge legitimacy transfer consequence breakthrough hard overstate marc andreessen one bitcoin single unit bitcoin btc digital currency like dollar bitcoin value itself value agree trade good service bring currency control believe others same keep track amount bitcoin u owns blockchain us ledger digital file track bitcoin transaction fig bitcoin ledger digital file simplified ledger file stored central entity server like bank single data center distributed across world via network private computer storing data executing computation computer represents node blockchain network copy ledger file david want send bitcoins sandra broadcast message network say amount bitcoin account go btc amount sandras account increase quantity node network receive message apply requested transaction copy ledger updating account balance fig transaction request message simplified fact ledger maintained group connected computer rather centralized entity like bank several implication bank system know transaction account balance blockchain everyone see everyone el transaction generally trust bank bitcoin network distributed something go wrong help desk call anyone sue blockchain system designed way trust needed security reliability obtained via special mathematical function code define blockchain system allows group connected computer maintain single updated secure ledger order perform transaction blockchain need wallet program allows store exchange bitcoins since able spend bitcoins wallet protected special cryptographic method us unique pair distinct connected key private public key message encrypted specific public key owner paired private key decrypt read message reverse also true encrypt message private key paired public key decrypt it david want send bitcoins need broadcast message encrypted private key wallet david one know private key necessary unlock wallet one spend bitcoins node network crosscheck transaction request coming david decrypting message public key wallet encrypt transaction request wallet private key generating digital signature used blockchain computer verify source authenticity transaction digital signature string text resulting transaction request private key therefore cannot used transaction change single character transaction request message digital signature change potential attacker change transaction request alter amount bitcoin sending fig digital signature transaction encryption simplified send bitcoin need prove private key specific wallet need key encrypt transaction request message since broadcast message encrypted never reveal private key tracking wallet balance node blockchain keeping copy ledger so node know account balance blockchain system doesnt keep track account balance all record every transaction verified approved ledger fact keep track balance keep track every transaction broadcasted within bitcoin network fig determine wallet balance need analyze verify transaction ever took place whole network connected wallet fig blockchain ledger balance verification performed based link previous transaction order send bitcoins john mary generate transaction request includes link previous incoming transaction add least bitcoins link called input node network verify amount ensure input havent spent yet fact time reference input transaction deemed invalid future transaction performed automatically mary wallet doublechecked bitcoin network node sends btc transaction john wallet using public key fig blockchain transaction request structure so system trust input transaction valid check previous transaction correlated wallet use send bitcoins via input reference speed verification process special record unspent transaction kept network node thanks security check possible doublespend bitcoins owning bitcoins mean transaction written ledger point wallet address havent used input yet code perform transaction bitcoin network open source mean anyone laptop internet connection operate transaction however mistake code used broadcast transaction request message associated bitcoins permanently lost remember since network distributed customer support call anyone could help restore lost transaction forgotten wallet password reason interested transacting bitcoin network good idea use open source official version bitcoin wallet software such bitcoin core store wallet password private key safe repository really safe called blockchain anyone access bitcoin network via anonymous connection for example tor network vpn network submit receive transaction revealing nothing public key however someone us public key over possible connect transaction owner bitcoin network allows generate many wallet like private public key allows receive payment different wallet way anyone know wallet private key unless send received bitcoins single wallet total number possible bitcoin address large number protects network possible attack allowing anyone wallet setup still major security hole could exploited recall bitcoins spending them transaction passed node node within network order two transaction reach node different attacker could send transaction wait counterpart ship product send reverse transaction back account case node could receive second transaction first therefore consider initial payment transaction invalid transaction input would marked already spent know transaction requested first secure order transaction timestamp could easily counterfeit therefore way tell transaction happened another open potential fraud happens disagreement among network node regarding order transaction received blockchain system designed use node agreement order transaction prevent fraud described above bitcoin network order transaction grouping block block contains definite number transaction link previous block put one block time block therefore organized timerelated chain fig give name whole system blockchain fig the block chain sequence structure simplified transaction block considered happened time transaction yet block considered unconfirmed node group transaction block broadcast network suggestion block next since node suggest new block system agree block next added blockchain block must contain answer complex mathematical problem created using irreversible cryptographic hash function way solve mathematical problem guess random number that combined previous block content generate defined result could take year typical computer guess right number solve mathematical problem however due large number computer network guessing number block solved average every minute node solves mathematical problem acquires right place next block chain broadcast network two node solve problem time send block network simultaneously case block broadcast node build block received first however blockchain system requires node build immediately longest blockchain available ambiguity last block soon next block solved node adopt longest chain option fig end chain ambiguity logic due low probability solving block simultaneously almost impossible multiple block would solved time over building different tail whole blockchain stabilizes quickly one single string block every node agrees on disagreement block represents end chain tail open potential fraud again transaction happens block belongs shorter tail like block b fig next block solved transaction along others block go back unconfirmed transaction transaction bitcoin blockchain system protected mathematical race attacker competing whole network let see mary could leverage endofchain ambiguity perform doublespending attack mary sends money john john ship product mary since node always adopt longer tail confirmed transaction mary could generate longer tail contains reverse transaction input reference john would money product fig mary doublespending attack system prevent kind fraud block contains reference previous block see fig reference part mathematical problem need solved order spread following block network so extremely hard precompute series block due high number random guess needed solve block place blockchain mary race rest network solve math problem allows place next block chain even solves anyone else unlikely could solve two three block row since time competing whole network could mary use super fast computer generate enough random guess compete whole network solving block yes even very fast computer due large number member network highly unlikely mary could solve several block row exact time needed perform doublespending attack would need control percent computing power whole network percent chance solving block node doesand even case shed percent chance solving two block row block solves row lower probability success transaction bitcoin blockchain system protected mathematical race attacker competing entire network therefore transaction grow secure time included block confirmed one hour ago example secure block confirmed last minute since block added chain every minute average transaction included block first time hour ago likely processed irreversible fig blockchain transaction security mining bitcoin order send bitcoins need reference incoming transaction wallet applies every single transaction across network so bitcoins come first place way balance deflationary nature bitcoin due software error wallet password loss reward given solve mathematical problem block activity running bitcoin blockchain software order obtain bitcoin reward called miningand much like mining gold reward main incentive private people operate node thus providing necessary computing power process transaction stabilize blockchain network take long time typical computer solve block about one year average node band together group divide number guess solve next block working group speed process guessing right number getting reward shared among group member group called mining pool mining pool large represent percent total network computing power clear implication network security seen doublespend attack example above even one pool could potentially gain percent network computing power back along chain block go secure transaction within become however mining pool substantial computing power decided limit member order safeguard overall network security since overall network computing power likely increase time due technological innovation increasing number node blockchain system recalibrates mathematical difficulty solving next block target minute average entire network ensures network stability overall security moreover every four year block reward cut half mining bitcoin running network get le interesting time encourage node keep operating small reward fee attached transaction reward collected node successfully includes transaction block solves mathematical problem due mechanism transaction associated higher reward usually processed faster associated low reward mean that sending transaction decide youd like process faster more expensive cheaper take time transaction fee bitcoin network currently small compared bank charge theyre associated transaction amount blockchain benefit challenge general understanding blockchain work let take quick look interesting using blockchain technology remarkable benefit complete control value own third party hold value limit access it cost perform value transaction anywhere planet low allows micropayments value transferred minute transaction considered secure hour rather day week anyone time verify every transaction made blockchain resulting full transparency possible leverage blockchain technology build decentralized application would able manage information transfer value fast securely however challenge need addressed transaction sent received anonymously preserve user privacy also allows illegal activity network though many exchange platform emerging digital currency gaining popularity still easy trade

found bank balance sheet calculate return asset simply divide net income total asset multiply express percentage example well fargo produced net income billion total asset trillion end year dividing two number multiplying show roa now were going complicate thing little want accurate calculation possible roa or roe need take average asset equity time period considering case bank annual roe best practice take average asset end last five quarter well fargo fivequarter average asset trillion produce slightly higher roa return equity return equity need net income well total shareholder equity found balance sheet formula roe similar roa formula except divide equity instead continuing well fargo example determine bank fivequarter average equity billion using this along bank billion net income show roe net interest margin finally calculate net interest margin need determine bank net interest income find income statement subtract bank interest expense interest income then divide bank asset similarly two metric use fivequarter average asset order produce accurate nim well fargo income statement show interest income billion interest expense billion therefore calculate net interest income billion net interest margin so good profitability term roa roe respectively generally considered good performance number and fourth quarter industry average roa roe net interest margin tends
