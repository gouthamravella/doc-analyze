The telecommunications industry is made up of all telephone and internet service providers, which play a big role in improving our mobile communication It covers everything from voice calls, texting, email, to images and video streaming The rising growth of this field comes with the demand of skilled employees to facilitate this growth in the best possible manner
India Today spoke to Santanu Bhattacharya, Vertical Anchor, Telecom, TISS SVE, on the growth of the telecommunications industry, job roles in demand now and employable skills
Describe the state of the telecommunications industry and its growth process in India
Santanu Bhattacharya: In the last two decades, the telecom industry in India has seen phenomenal growth Between FY 07-16 India's telephone subscriber base expanded at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 195 per cent to 1,02261 million and teledensity to 8098 (ref http://wwwibeforg) 

About the growth pattern:
	This growth attributes to the penetration of mobile phones and services as well as internet (broadband) connectivity and services
	This growth pattern and rate is poised to continue during the next couple of decades because of growth in smart phone sales, 3G and 4G services and rural penetration of telecom services
	Telecommunications happens to be an industry where technology changes very rapidly making obsolete the older technologies which cannot provide new and essential as well as lifestyle type services (eg use of WhatsApp, banking services, mobile phone as a camera, etc)
	Consequently, the demand for skilled resources in every segment of the telecom industry has been and will continue to be much higher than what the current education or skill development system can supply

How telecom companies can win in the digital revolution
How telecom companies can win in the digital revolution

For telecoms, making smart use of digital technologies calls for a wholesale digital transformation Five steps are needed to make it happen
Telecom companies face increasingly tough times as digitization reshapes the industry landscape In fact, telecoms come second only to media in the ranks of sectors expecting moderate or massive digital disruption over the next 12 months, according to a 2015 cross-industry survey of senior industry leaders1
In the past five years, the telecom business has entered a period of slow decline, with revenue growth down from 45 percent to 4 percent, EBITDA margins down from 25 percent to 17 percent, and cash-flow margins down from 156 percent to 8 percent2 Competitive boundaries are shifting as core voice and messaging businesses continue to shrink, partly under regulatory pressures, but also because social media is opening up new communications channels Among US telecom companies, for instance, landline and mobile voice now account for less than a third of total access, down from 55 percent in 2010, while data revenue has risen from 25 percent of total revenues in 2010 to 65 percent today
But digitization is not just a threat; it also offers telecom companies an opportunity to rebuild their market positions, reimagine their business systems, and create innovative offerings for customers Not surprisingly, most executives consider digitization to be one of their top priorities,3 but few companies are close to capturing its full potential We calculate that digitization could enable telecom operators to improve their profits by as much as 35 percent, yet the average improvement achieved is just 9 percent
So how can companies bridge this gap We have identified five ways to come out on top of the digital revolution
1 Reinvent the core
Digitization touches almost every aspect of a telecom operators business:
Omnichannel sales Todays consumers engage with multiple channels during their customer journey Customers increasingly visit stores to look at products before buying online, but even more do the opposite, researching products online before completing their purchase in a store Great customer journeys call for excellence in every interaction, clear cross-channel pathways, and a seamless customer experience Stores need radical reform, too, not just to reduce their footprint but to transform the customer experience they offer Investing in digital sales has enabled some leaders to increase revenues by 30 percent and reduce commercial costs by a similar proportion
E-care Digital is now the leading channel in many customer-service transactions, too Among a sample of telecom companies in Western Europe, 89 percent of service journeys occurred partly or entirely online (Exhibit 1) Customers prefer digital service, with 76 percent of telecom customers satisfied with digital-only journeys, compared with 57 percent for traditional channels However, few service journeys are entirely digital as yet: just 15 percent are digital from start to finish, while 41 percent begin on an e-care platform and then switch to traditional channels For telecom operators, migrating to e-care can reduce call volumes and operating expenses by 25 to 30 percent One company that launched an e-care effort as part of a broader digital sales transformation saw a 40 percent reduction in customer-care costs as well as a rise in customer satisfaction

 Is telecom sector good to choose as a career option


Answer written in view of indian telecom Industry:-
Let me tell you frankly golden era of indian telco industry is over atleast for next 34 years
Telco are under huge pressure in terms of revenue generation Voice which generates 80% of revenue(2 years back) is now almost free which brought down there revenue to historical low level
Only hope was from data consumption kickoff but entrance of a new telco which created greatest disrution of inian teleco industry & provides data at very cheap rates which again has almost ruined the chances of any improvement in health of this industry
Some companies which have big presence in this market have closed down their operations,some went for mergers & ultimately results in joblessness
So overall if you have any other career option then please go for itBut if you have Decided to join telco then you have to be really patient & wait for growth in the sector to take off which may happen at arrival of 5G & IOT

Telecommunications: industry sector overview
Engineers in the constantly changing telecoms industry can opt to work for a vendor or a supplier
The main objective of the telecoms industry is to allow people to communicate, whether they're talking on traditional fixed-line telephones, or using mobile devices to send and receive data from the cloud Employers include BT, Virgin Media, Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nortel, Vodafone, O2 and EE, as well as IT consultancy providers such as Accenture and IBM
The sector is broadly split into vendors and carriers: vendor companies such as Metaswitch, Broadsoft and Ericsson sell the hardware and software products that carrier companies such as BT, AT&T and Yahoo! use in their networks
Activities vary by company and industry sector, but generally include research and development of hardware or software, technical sales and marketing, and installation and technical support Companies that run large networks and data centres are also involved in infrastructure and networking activities
ADVERTISE HERE
Trends and developments in the telecoms industry
The big trend in IT at the moment, which is relevant to telecoms, is virtualisation, which is most commonly seen in cloud computing It is useful, therefore, for students and graduates to have an awareness of cloud computing, software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualisation (NFV)
What it's like working in telecoms
Roles are mostly office-based, although it is often possible to work from home There are opportunities to travel and work abroad, but mobility is not usually a requirement Teamwork is a major aspect of most roles, and those working in infrastructure or support teams are often client-facing There isnt a culture of working very long hours, but things do get more pressured when youre close to releasing a new product The sector has remained fairly recession-proof owing to the continued requirement for telecommunications solutions
Projects might include designing and developing new products, product testing, setting up infrastructure and supporting customers The pace of the work depends on your role: a developer or designer might have a moderately-paced project whereas a colleague in support will work much faster to deal with customer issues
Getting a graduate engineering job in the telecoms industry
Entry requirements vary across the industry depending on the role and the company to which you are applying Its important, however, to have strong problem solving abilities and excellent communication skills
Any demonstrable interest in IT and technology is an advantage This could be gained through joining a club at university or working with IT in your spare time Work experience is useful, but not essential It is also beneficial to be aware of general trends affecting the industry and be able to talk about them sensibly
Most graduates who work for vendors of equipment and software start in a technical role in hardware or software development to gain experience that lets them move into other roles The entry roles for carriers are more varied and often require specialist knowledge
The highlights of a career in telecoms
	Working at the cutting edge of technology
	The huge range of jobs offered by the sector
	The challenges of scalability involved in rolling out huge telecoms networks
The telecoms industry seeks graduates from the following disciplines:
	control
	electronics
	instruments
	materials
	physics
	software
	telecoms

Public and Private Players
MTNL, BSNL, VSNL are the major Public Players, whereas Airtel, Idea, Hutch, Tata, Reliance, BPL are the leading Private Players in the country Some of them are entering foreign markets as well The Bharti Telecom will be launching its services for the NRIs in the US with the help of Airtel CALLHOME service
The market shares of the leading public and Private Players
 
INVESTMENT AND GROWTH
In 2005-2006, the telecom industry witnessed a growth of 21% with a total revenue of Rs 86,720 crores, and the total investment rising to Rs 2,00,660 crores It is projected that the telecom industry will be enjoying over 150% growth in the next 4-6 years The growth also requires a huge investment by the players in the sector Bharti Airtel is planning to invest about $8 billion by the year 2010
Liberalization policy and some socio-economic factors are mainly responsible for the immense growth in the sales volumes The lifestyle of the people has changed They need to be connected to the other people all the time With the lowering down of the tariffs the affordability of the mobile phones has increased The finance sector has also come up with loans for handsets on 0% interest Mobile services providers are also expanding their coverage area by installing more and more antennas and other equipments
The telecom sector in the country has already adopted the latest technological advancements to cater to the demands of the growing market Telecom Expo India, Convergence India, VAS India and IPTV India being organized year to year are all efforts in this direction
Budget 2007 has brought disappointment to the telecom sector Mobile service providers have been asked to cut down their roaming rentals as well as their long distance and international call tariffs This has led to discontent on the part of the service providers However, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is of the opinion that this will lead to increased use of roaming, which will ultimately lead to more revenue generation Moreover, with cheaper handsets and lesser tariffs, it is expected that by the year 2010 there will be over 500 million subscribers in the Indian telecom market
Also, the telecom industry this year will be focusing more on rural areas to connect them with the urban areas so that the farmers and the small-scale industries can have faster access to information related to weather and market conditions
EMPLOYMENT STATUS
With the coming of more and more projects, the telecom industry is going for high scale recruitments There is a huge demand for software engineers, mobile analysts, and hardware engineers for mobile handsets Besides, there are ample opportunities for marketing people whose services are required to capture more and more customer base

From last few years telecom sector in India is going through rough phase starting from 2G scandal, Vodafone tax case, low tariff, 1012 players in a circle & last but not least entry of JIO which at the other end benefited consumer but badly affected entire telecom sector
Now existing players are struggling to sustain in market M&A are in process I think sector will bounce back once 5G & IOT was introduced but it will take timebut now it will be purely data driven market not by voice Trai & DOT has to play vital role here to maintain healthy balance between consumer & telcos

How Telecom Technology is Changing in 2017
This column is authored by Jill Ji, Researcher, Cozlink
________________________________________
Telecom industry has come a very long way since the days of wired handsets and limited communication features enabled gadgets The telecom networks have undergone a mind-blowing transformation to meet the content delivery networks From copper cabled to fiber optic cable equipped telecom technology, the journey has really been an interesting one The focus still continues to enable delivery of speedier than before networks Innovators have been successful in bringing multi-utility factor to the telecom products and so, there is a prevalence of multi-port adapters, splitters and breakout cables in the telecom networks so that various enhancement goals can be achieved
Given the fact that the change is the most constant factor in the technology world, this is how the telecommunications sector continues to populate and prosper in 2017:
1 Networks with higher speeds
5G is the biggest cry of the hour It is being talked about amongst masses as well as experts and everybody, with their eyes strictly on the developments, is eager to find how the world is going to change after 5G This sudden upsurge in the demand of 5G networks has made way for newer transceivers and other networking equipment in the latest data center networks
2 Optics to the desktop
The users have now realized the fact that the optical fiber networks are still not leveraged to their fullest potential Therefore, the packages like VoIP, Telecom and Internet rolled into a single unit are the latest in the row of development taking place in the telecom industry Internet of Things and the huge market of wearable computers have been keeping the innovators on toes and their prevalence is going to be an evitable thing in coming times In 2017, one can rightly say that the world will be preparing itself to adapt to the new products having technological finesse These products would be considered as nothing more than the next inevitable milestone in the course of events happening in the telecom sector
3 Ubiquitous nature of telecom networks
Delivering content to any gadget whether it is a phone or a laptop is a thing that is certainly going to find the importance in the telecom development Connected cars, smart homes, and smarter fleet and not to forget, smart cities are the latest fad developing in the telecom industry Delivering uninterrupted and ubiquitous telecom networks offering Internet as well as calling facility wherever the user requires is going to be the main focus use and cities across the world seem to be in competition with each other to grab the position of telecom innovations in the coming few years; most of the technology has already been put to achieve the status of the smartest city in the world
4 Enhanced focus on security and encrypted applications
Such an increased level of penetration of the smart gadgets into the lives of the people definitely requires putting more stringent safety features in place Better quality of encryption, protection against eavesdropping and enhanced clarity of telecom signals are some of the areas that still pose a challenge and 5G networks along with better security cover are expected to deliver the results that guarantee all of it
5 Increased quality of asset monitoring
There is an unprecedented increase in the competition amongst top players in the telecom market With more and more dealers and innovators entering the market every year, it has become a challenge for the leaders to maintain their market share So, asset monitoring and its protection have come the top priority in the telecom sector 2017 is also going to be the year of mergers and acquisitions The conditions are ripe for buying the technology instead of creating and that is why; market incumbents with similar mindsets are becoming the ideal merger material for the mightier ones
6 Low revenue from calling sector
Voice messaging, Chat applications and Skype calls are trending all over the places in the telecom industry This has slashed down the revenues from calling markets substantially To make the matters in favor, revenue generation model in telecom sector is certainly going to undergo a change
7 Simplification is the key
With so many players in the market, one that is able to provide the simplest solution to the consumers is certainly going to fetch the maximum revenue share Telecom industry players are supposed to serve the customers in the fastest way possible to win the faith as well as patronage Thus, single unified solutions that help maintain database too, are the need of the hours and many proactive telecom companies are now working hard to integrate customer service with data mining so that personalized and simple customer service can be made possible
8 Building strategy that supports adjacent verticals
Various telecom companies have forayed into the adjacent verticals like lifestyle services, e-commerce etc Extending facilities like providing handsets, as started by the network providers, is a trend worth watching for Though the present regulatory caps are not that much encouraging, with changing times, the authorities are surely going to offer a more flexible framework for the companies involved in the multi-vertical business model
It is, therefore, right to say that the current as well as coming year is dedicated to making telecom a place one has only dreamt of till now Single window service is the ultimate picture of telecom industry and all the companies are seen working for it presently and become a master of it in coming times

Telecommunications
By Paul Linnell
 Since the invention of the telephone more than a century ago, its use has slowly penetrated our society and changed the business and private lives of people the world over  But more recently and more rapidly, the mobile phone and the Internet have completely changed the way we communicate, the way we do business and even the way we plan and live our lives
This dramatic social change has brought significant customer service challenges to an industry now striving to keep pace with the increasing expectations of its own customers
inShare
 
The phone company is no longer just about phones and a phone is no longer just a handy way to communicate

A social, technical and economic revolution:
The phone company is no longer just about telephones, and a phone is no longer just a convenient way to communicate One by one, the products and services offered by telecommunications companies have transitioned from the curios of the wealthy to the tools of every trade
Delivering this change has placed telecommunications companies at the leading edge of the consumer electronics industry The ease of use of their products, and the accessibility and reliability of their services can have a dramatic impact on the business and private lives of their customers
Customers no longer see outages as an inconvenient symptom of a pioneering technology They expect telecommunications companies to provide the reliability and service to match a new dependency This transition has brought significant additional risks and challenges to an industry already faced with the aggressive business environment of the 21st century - reduced margins, increased competition and the increased ease with which customers can make their dissatisfaction public knowledge, and change their supplier
The challenge for telecommunications companies is to combine their technological and business expertise with the growing need for a customer service vision that will build their future success on the success they help bring to their customers
Meeting the challenges of a new customer paradigm:
This new customer paradigm can only be achieved by applying the same degree of discipline and determination that telecommunication companies have applied to the technology revolution However, building a customer-driven organisation requires a different set of tools, techniques and strategies from those needed to build a digital exchange or a cellular network
The toolset for customer experience management requires a business model that places the value that the business offers its customers, and the value its customers offer the business, at its centre Surrounding this core are the activities that effectively manage customer experience, adding value for the customer, and hence returning value to the business
Telecommunications companies that successfully combine a robust customer-driven business model with enterprise-wide commitment to the transformation will be best positioned to take industry leadership with customer AND technology services

In recent years, the word telecommunications has been used so often, and applied in so many situations, that it has become part of our daily lexicon, yet its definition remains elusive So, let's start with a definition The word telecommunications has its roots in Greek: tele means "over a distance," and communicara means "the ability to share" Hence, telecommunications literally means "the sharing of information over a distance" Telecommunications is more than a set of technologies, it's more than an enormous global industry (estimated to be US$25 trillion), it's more than twenty-first-century business and law that is being re-created to accommodate a virtual world, and it's more than a creator and destroyer of the state of the economy Telecommunications is a way of life Telecommunications affects how and where you do everythinglive, work, play, socialize, entertain, serve, study, teach, rest, heal, and protect Telecommunications has served a critical role in shaping society and culture, as well as in shaping business and economics
It is important to examine telecommunications from the broadest perspective possible to truly appreciate the depth and complexity of this field and thereby understand the opportunities it affords The best way to learn to "think telecom" is to quickly examine how it is changing both business and lifestyle
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, much of the IT&T (information technologies and telecommunications) industry's focus was on how to reengineer the likes of financial institutions, manufacturing, retail, service, and government These technology deployments were largely pursued and justified on the grounds of reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness by speeding communications
Today, we are shifting our focus to another set of objectives: Our technology deployments are targeted at supporting not just the needs of a business enterprise, but also those of the consumers The revolution in integrated media is transforming all aspects of human activity related to communication and information We are moving to computer-based environments that support the creation, sharing, and distribution of multimodal information Whereas traditional telecommunications networks have allowed us to cross barriers associated with time and distance, the new multimedia realm is allowing us to include vital physical cues in the information stream, introducing a physical reality into the world of electronic communications, goods, and services Not surprisingly, some of the industries that are being most radically revolutionized are those that deal with the human senses, including entertainment, health care, education, advertising, and, sadly, warfare In each of these key sectors, there are telecommunications solutions that address the business need, reduce costs, or enhance operations by speeding business processes and aiding communications These industries are also examining how to virtualize their products and/or servicesthat is, how to apply telecommunications to support electronic services targeted at the consumers of that industry's products Not surprisingly, changing the way you attend a class, see a doctor, watch a movie, get a date, shop for software, take a cruise, and stay in touch creates significant changes in how you use your time and money Simply put, technology changes your way and pace of life
This chapter presents the big picture of the telecommunications revolution, and the rest of the book gives greater detail about the specific technologies and applications that will comprise the telecommunications future
Changes in Telecommunications
A quick orientation of how emerging technologies are affecting industries and lifestyle highlights the importance of understanding the principles of telecommunications, and, hopefully, to inspire you to "think telecom" The changes discussed here are ultimately very important to how telecommunications networks will evolve and to where the growth areas will be
An enormous amount of the activity driving telecommunications has to do with the emergence of advanced applications; likewise, advances in telecommunications capabilities spur developments in computing platforms and capabilities The two are intimately and forever intertwined The following sections discuss some of the changes that are occurring in both telecommunications and in computing platforms and applications, as well as some of the changes expected in the next several years
Incorporating Human Senses in Telecommunications
Telecommunications has allowed a virtual world to emergeone in which time and distance no longer represent a barrier to doing business or communicatingbut we're still lacking something that is a critical part of the human information-processing realm The human mind acts on physical sensations in the course of its information processing; the senses of sight, sound, touch, and motion are key to our perception and decision making Developments in sensory technologies and networks will allow a new genre of sensory reality to emerge, bridging the gap between humans and machines One of the most significant evolutions occurring in computing and communications is the introduction of the human senses into electronic information streams The following are a few of the key developments in support of this more intuitive collaborative humanmachine environment:
	Computers are now capable of hearing and speaking, as demonstrated by Tellme, a popular US voice-activated service that responds to defined voice prompts and provides free stock quotes, weather information, and entertainment guides to 35,000 US cities
	The capability to produce three-dimensional sound through digital masterya technology called "virtual miking"is being developed at the University of Southern California's Integrated Media Systems Center
	Virtual touch, or haptics, enables a user to reach in and physically interact with simulated computer content, such as feeling the weight of the Hope diamond in your hand or feeling the fur of a lion Two companies producing technology in this area are SensAble Technologies and Immersion Corporation They are producing state-of-the-art force feedback, whole-hand sensing, and real-time 3D interaction technologies, and these hardware and software products have a wide range of applications for the manufacturing and consumer markets, including virtual-reality job training, computer-aided design, remote handling of hazardous materials, and "touch" museums
	The seduction of smell is also beginning to find its way into computers, allowing marketers to capitalize on the many subtle psychological states that smell can induce Studies show that aromas can be used to trigger fear, excitement, and many other emotions Smell can be used to attract visitors to Web sites, to make them linger longer and buy more, to help them assimilate and retain information, or to instill the most satisfying or terrifying of emotional states (now that's an interactive game!) Three companies providing this technology today are Aromajet, DigiScents, and TriSenx Aromajet, for example, creates products that address video games, entertainment, medical, market research, personal and home products, and marketing and point of sales applications
	The visual information stream provides the most rapid infusion of information, and a large portion of the human brain is devoted to processing visual information To help humans process visual information, computers today can see; equipped with video cameras, computers can capture and send images, and can display high-quality entertainment programming The visual stream is incredibly demanding in terms of network performance; thus, networks today are rapidly preparing to enable this most meaningful of information streams to be easily distributed
The Emergence of Wearables
How we engage in computing and communications will change dramatically in the next decade Portable computing devices have changed our notion of what and where a workplace is and emphasized our desire for mobility and wireless communication; they are beginning to redefine the phrase dressed for success But the portable devices we know today are just a stepping stone on the way to wearables Context-aware wearable computing will be the ultimate in light, ergonomic, reliable, flexible, and scalable platforms Products that are available for use in industrial environments today will soon lead to inexpensive, easy-to-use wearables appearing at your neighborhood electronics store:
	Xybernaut's Mobile Assistant IV (MA-IV), a wearable computer, provides its wearer with a full-fledged PC that has a 233MHz Pentium chip, 32MB memory, and upward of 3GB storage A wrist keyboard sports 60 keys Headgear suspended in front of the eye provides a full-color VGA screen, the size of a postage stamp but so close to the eye that images appear as on a 15-inch monitor A miniature video camera fits snugly in a shirt pocket Bell Canada workers use MA-IVs in the field; they replace the need to carry manuals and provide the ability to send images and video back to confer with supervisors The MA-IV is rather bulky, weighing in at 44 pounds (2 kilograms), but the soon-to-be-released MA-V will be the first mass-market version, and it promises to be lightweight
	MIThril is the next-generation wearables research platform currently in development at MIT's Media Lab It is a functional, operational body-worn computing architecture for context-aware human-computer interaction research and general-purpose wearable computing applications The MIThril architecture combines a multiprotocol body bus and body network, integrating a range of sensors, interfaces, and computing cores It is designed to be integrated into everyday clothing, and it is both ergonomic and flexible It combines small, light-weight RISC processors (including the StrongARM), a single-cable power/data "body bus," and high-bandwidth wireless networking in a package that is nearly as light, comfortable, and unobtrusive as ordinary street clothing
To be truly useful, wearables will need to be aware of where you are and what you're doing Armed with this info, they will be able to give you information accordingly (Location-based services are discussed in Chapter 14, "Wireless Communications")
Bandwidth
A term that you hear often when discussing telecommunications is bandwidth Bandwidth is a critical commodity Historically, bandwidth has been very expensive, as it was based on the sharing of limited physical resources, such as twisted-pair copper cables and coax Bandwidth is largely used today to refer to the capacity of a network or a telecom link, and it is generally measured in bits per second (bps) Bandwidth actually refers to the range of frequencies involvedthat is, the difference between the lowest and highest frequencies supportedand the greater the range of frequencies, the greater the bandwidth, and hence the greater the number of bits per second, or information carried
Figure 11 The analogy of a hose is often used to describe bandwidth
Moving Toward Pervasive Computing
As we distribute intelligence across a wider range of devices, we are experiencing pervasive computing,also called ubiquitous computing We are taking computers out of stand-alone boxes to which we are tied and putting them into ordinary things, in everyday objects around us These new things, because they are smart, have a sense of self-awareness and are able to take care of themselves When we embed intelligence into a device, we create an interesting new opportunity for business That device has to have a reason for being, and it has to have a reason to continue evolving so that you will spend more money and time on it To address this challenge, device manufacturers are beginning to bundle content and applications with their products The result is smart refrigerators, smart washing machines, smart ovens, smart cabinets, smart furniture, smart beds, smart televisions, smart toothbrushes, and an endless list of other smart devices (These smart devices are discussed in detail in Chapter 15, "The Broadband Home and HANs")
Devices are becoming smaller and more powerful all the time, and they're getting physically closer to our bodies, as well The growing amount of intelligence distributed throughout the network is causing changes in user profiles
Moving Toward Machine-to-Machine Communications
We are moving away from human-to-human communications to an era of machine-to-machine communications Today, there are just over 6 billion human beings on the planet, yet the number of microprocessors is reported to be more than 15 billion Devices have become increasingly intelligent, and one characteristic of an intelligent system is that it can communicate As the universe of communications-enabled devices grows, so does the traffic volume between them As these smart things begin to take on many of the tasks and communications that humans traditionally exchanged, they will change the very fabric of our society For example, your smart washing machine will initiate a call to the service center to report a problem and schedule resolution with the help of an intelligent Web agent long before you even realize that something is wrong! These developments are predicted to result in the majority of trafficup to 95% of itbeing exchanged between machines, with traditional human-to-human communications representing only 5% of the network traffic by 2010
Adapting to New Traffic Patterns
Sharing of information can occur in a number of waysvia smoke signals, by letters sent through the postal service, or as transmissions through electrical or optical media, for example Before we get into the technical details of the technologies in the industry, it's important to understand the driving forces behind computing and communications You need to understand the impact these forces have on network traffic and therefore on network infrastructure In today's environment, telecommunications embodies four main traffic types, each of which has different requirements in terms of network capacity, tolerance for delaysand particularly variations in the delayin the network, and tolerance for potential congestion and therefore losses in the network:
	VoiceVoice traffic has been strong in the developed world for years, and more subscriber lines are being deployed all the time However, some three billion people in the world haven't even used a basic telephone yet, so there is yet a huge market to be served Voice communications are typically referred to as being narrowband, meaning that they don't require a large amount of network capacity For voice services to be intelligible and easy to use, delays must be kept to a minimum, however, so the delay factors in moving information from Point A to Point B have to be tightly controlled in order to support real-time voice streams (Concepts such as delay, latency, and error control are discussed in Chapter 6, "Data Communications Basics")
	DataData communications refers to the exchange of digitized information between two machines Depending on the application supported, the bandwidth or capacity requirements can range from medium to high As more objects that are visual in nature (such as images and video) are included with the data, that capacity demand increases Depending again on the type of application, data may be more or less tolerant of delays Text-based exchanges are generally quite tolerant of delays But again, the more real-time nature there is to the information type, as in video, the tighter the control you need over the latencies Data traffic is growing much faster than voice traffic; it has grown at an average rate of about 30% to 40% per year for the past decade To accommodate data communication, network services have been developed to address the need for greater capacity, cleaner transmission facilities, and smarter network management tools Data encompasses many different information types In the past, we saw these different types as being separate entities (for example, video and voice in a videoconference), but in the future, we must be careful not to separate things this way because, after all, in the digital age, all data is represented as ones and zeros
	ImageImage communications requires medium to high bandwidththe greater the resolution required, the greater the bandwidth required For example, many of the images taken in medical diagnostics require very high resolution Image traffic tolerates some delay because it includes no motion artifacts that would be affected by any distortions in the network
	VideoVideo communications, which are becoming increasingly popular and are requiring ever-greater bandwidth, are extremely sensitive to delay The future is about visual communications We need to figure out how to make video available over a network infrastructure that can support it and at a price point that consumers are willing to pay When our infrastructures are capable of supporting the capacities and the delay limitations required by real-time applications, video will grow by leaps and bounds
All this new voice, data, and video traffic means that there is growth in backbone traffic levels as well This is discussed further later in the chapter, in the section "Increasing Backbone Bandwidth"
The telecommunications revolution has spawned great growth in the amount and types of traffic, and we'll see even more types of traffic as we begin to incorporate human senses as part of the network The coming chapters talk in detail about what a network needs in order to handle the various traffic types
Handling New Types of Applications
The new traffic patterns imply that the network will also be host to a new set of applicationsnot just simple voice or text-based data, but to new genres of applications that combine the various media types
The ability to handle digital entertainment applications in a network is crucial In some parts of the world, such as Asia, education may have primary focus, and that should tell us where we can expect greater success going forward But throughout much of the world, entertainment is where people are willing to spend the limited numbers of dollars that they have to spend on electronic goods and services The digital entertainment realm will include video editing, digital content creation, digital imaging, 3D gaming, and virtual reality applications, and all these will drive the evolution of the network It's the chicken and the egg story: What comes first, the network or the applications Why would you want a fiber-optic broadband connection if there's nothing good to draw over that connection Why would you want to create a 3D virtual reality application when there's no way to distribute it The bottom line is that the applications and the infrastructures have to evolve hand-in-hand to manifest the benefits and the dollars we associate with their future
Another form of application that will be increasingly important is in the realm of streaming media A great focus is put on the real-time delivery of information, as in entertainment, education, training, customer presentations, IPO trade shows, and telemedicine consultations (Streaming media is discussed in detail in Chapter 11, "Next-Generation Network Services")
E-commerce (electronic commerce) and m-commerce (mobile commerce) introduce several new requirements for content management, transaction platforms, and privacy and security tools, so they affect the types of information that have to be encoded into the basic data stream and how the network deals with knowledge of what's contained within those packets (Security is discussed in detail in Chapter 11)
Increasing Backbone Bandwidth
Many of the changes discussed so far, but primarily the changes in traffic patterns and applications, will require immense amounts of backbone bandwidth Table 11 lists a number of the requirements that emerging applications are likely to make on backbone bandwidth
Table 11 Backbone Bandwidth Requirements for Advanced Applications


In addition, advances in broadband access technologies will drive a demand for additional capacity in network backbones Once 100Gbps broadband residential access becomes availableand there are developments on the horizonthe core networks will require capacities measured in exabits per second (that is, 1 billion Gbps) These backbone bandwidth demands make the revolutionary forces of optical networking critical to our future (Optical networking is discussed in detail in Chapter 12, "Optical Networking")
Metric Prefixes and Equivalents
The following table defines commonly used metric prefixes:


For example, 10Gbps = 10,000,000,000bps, and 4KHz = 4,000Hz (that is, cycles per second)
The following shows the relationships of commonly used units of measure to one another:
1Kbps = 1,000bps
1Gbps = 1,000Mbps
1Tbps = 1,000Gbps
1Pbps = 1,000Tbps
1Ebps = 1,000Pbps
Responding to Political and Regulatory Forces
New developments always bring with them politics Different groups vie for money, power, the ability to bring new products to market first and alone, and the right to squash others' new ideas A prominent characteristic of the telecommunications sector is the extent to which it is influenced by government policy and regulation The forces these exert on the sector are inextricably tied to technological and market forces
Because of the pervasive nature of information and communication technologies and the services that derive from them, coupled with the large prizes to be won, the telecommunications sector is subjected to a lot of attention from policymakers Particularly over the past 20 years or so, telecommunications policy and regulation have been prominent on the agendas of governments around the world This reflects the global trend toward liberalization, including, in many countries, privatization of the former monopoly telcos However, interest from policymakers in telecommunications goes much deeper than this A great deal of this interest stems from the extended reach and wide impact that information and communication technologies have Here are some examples:
	Telephony, e-mail, and information services permit contact between friends and families and offer convenience to people in running their day-to-day lives Thus, they have major economic and social implications
	In the business arena, information and communication technologies offer business efficiency and enable the creation of new business activities Thus, they have major employment and economic implications

Telecommunication is most commonly associated with inventions such as the telephone, fax machine, emails, and radio; essentially the ways in which we communicate on a daily basis The global telecom industry is one of the fastest developing that the world had seen before, and there can be little doubt that technology has played a huge role in its ever-changing fac With each invention, or a new idea, comes another wave in which the global population can communicate ideas, images, or conversation and it shows no signs of slowing, either Then came along the Internet and various ways it changed the Telecom landscape, especially with the current Internet of Things (IoT) revolution
The IoT has become increasingly visible and is growing at a phenomenal speed these days The sensor technologies that make things smart are only part of the IoT However connecting all these devices is what turns isolated pockets of technology into a network that generates and pools data in ways that lead to valuable insights In this era of internet revolution, communication services treated their network providers as little more than dumb network, just providing bandwidth The IoT revolution with its dramatic increase in strong, secure communication links offers the providers an opportunity to not only play a larger role but to create new value
Internet of Things comes with a concept that everything around should be electronically integrated and interconnected which is all about gathering and sharing of data Things like smart-phones, smart-watches, smart cars and smart homes are all on the rise, making the world around us unambiguous smart The rise of smart and connected things from wearable activity trackers to connected cars to the electrical grid allows companies to compete not only on the functionality and performance aspect of their products and services but also on the information created by the use of these products or services
Telecommunications is arguably the hub of the Internet of Things Technology around us is communicating and helping us gather and share information and these technologies are evolving and making other technologies out-dated Now days our lifestyle is around Internet of Things and many other objects that we interact with on a daily basis
To develop connected and smart IoT based system for our countrys economy, society, environment and global needs  The Indian Government's plan of developing 100 smart cities in the country It has earmarked Rs 7,060 crores in the current budget where IoT would play a key role in developing such cities This could lead to a quick expansion of IoT in the country Also, the launch of the Digital India Program by the Government, aims at transforming India into a digital empowered society and knowledge economy which will provide the required impetus for development of the IoT industry in the country The various initiatives proposed to be taken under the Smart City concept and the Digital India Program to setup Digital Infrastructure in the country would provide a boost the IoT ecosystem IoT offers avenues for telecom operators & system integrators to significantly boost their revenues, which has resulted in fast adoption of IoT applications and services Apart from direct IoT applications, the IT industry also has an opportunity to provide services, analytics and applications related to IoT
The IoT will continue to have a massive influence on consumer and enterprise business models and on human behavior patterns, supporting a move from owning to renting assets on the consumer side, and for businesses to move from selling products to offering services The M2M market is estimated to generate $71 billion in 2015 As per GSMA (GSM Association), the business impact of connected life is expected to be $45 trillion by 2020 for the global economy The widening scope of M2M is seen in sectors like healthcare, education, auto, agriculture, security, surveillance, etc The Smart Cities project is further expected to boost the IoT and the Internet and communication technologies market in India Telecom is a core backbone for all these technologies to be successful
In conclusion, the mid-nineties gave the industry The Internet which gave the next big jump to the industry Now Internet of Things is the next major trend that will impact the industry with connected devices playing a major role It will add billions of new connected data sources globally by 2020 India is at the apex of a digital revolution where it requires a regulatory impetus to realize this vision Although India aspires to become a digital economy ensuring connectivity across the length and breadth of the country, the blues of the telecom industry are hindering its true potential In this time frame, creation of an investor friendly environment is one of the principal requirements for innovation and progress in the telecom sector

5 Tech Trends in Telecommunications
 0  9  25 Google +2
 
Its no secret that the telecom industry is struggling with change and facing disruption It isnt sitting back watching the world pass it by, though Here are some of the top technologies that will help carry communications providers through the next generation
Connecting the IoT
It has already been established that being successful in the IoT market is going to take way more than neat devices, and that IoT is going to be more than just a way to flip on the A/C from an iPhone The IoT will become a complete ecosystem that connects everything we do, from the home to the car, to the workplace to the electrical grid Telecoms seem keenly aware of the potentialin 2015 the industry ranked 4th in IoT spending, committing nearly $111 million to IoT pursuits Telecoms are not going to sit back, build the infrastructure for it and watch the world ride piggyback with all the profits like they have in the past 10 years when more agile digital service providers ran roughshod over their business
Building infrastructure will indeed be part of the deal Massive amounts of M2M data will have to be moved quickly and securely Not to mention that much of it will be mobile, increasing commitments to 5G and secure carrier-grade WiFi networks However, telecom companies will also be providing services, and capitalizing on the valuable user data born from IoT devices Verizons recent investments in telematics shows not only a commitment to powering automotive IoT, but any thing that may require location services
Cloud Computing
Communications providers are facing some great challenges and opportunities in cloud computing They can potentially use the cloud to deliver higher quality, more flexible and more scalable enterprise IT services at lower cost than on-premise solutions On the consumer side, theres a big opportunity for communications providers to offer more cloud-based services that can be accessed, updated, and purchased from anywhere For example, the clunky, ugly, and outdated set top boxes (STBs) that have plagued our living rooms since the 70s might finally be on the way out Both Charter and Comcast are either offering or exploring cable and DVR services that live in the cloud, eliminating the need for the STB This reduces costs for the cable providers by eliminating the need for on-site installations and manufacturing and engineering new STBs every three years Not to mention that cloud accessibility may help lure back some cord-cutters that long ago retreated to Roku
Carrier-Grade WiFi
Remember how we said the communications industry will be going big in IoT Well, thats not going to happen if constant broadband connectivity is not available
When it comes to wireless connectivity over short distances, WiFi is hard to beat Theoretically, its faster than the leading alternative, 4G LTE, and can handle bandwidth-hogging services like mobile video for a fraction of the cost But in practice, todays WiFi hotspots are notoriously slow and fickle Thats about to change
The next generation of WiFi will have the same or better reliability as cellular, hence its carrier-grade moniker By 2020, more than 90% of wireless hotspots will be carrier grade, according to a 2015 WiFi industry survey
5G Wireless
The pressures of IoT on top of our insatiable desire for streaming video will absolutely decimate 4G LTE (Seriously, 325 BILLION hours of video is watched every month on YouTube alone Thats about 400,000 years, in case you were wondering) And according to Gartner, 208 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020 Thats a lot of YouTube-ing, Netflix-ing, and IoT-ing, and the fifth generation (sixth, if youre counting LTE) of wireless is being built to handle it 5G is projected to be about 10x faster than 4G, with download speeds around 10 GBPS
So how exactly does building all this new infrastructure benefit carriers Well, all the IoT services they are banking on will not work without it, for one The consumer revolt that is going to occur when 4G inevitably falls flat would be rather unpleasant as well
Testing of 5G has just begun and it wont be available until 2020, so hopefully WiFi will help fill in the gaps until then

How Telecommunications Have Changed Over The Past 20 Years
 
With rapid changes in Google's algorithm for mobile devices and the boom in mobile telecommunication, we thought why not share some historical background to give our readers some highlights of some of the biggest changes in Mobile technologyspecifically Telecommunication Industry because internet and of course blogging would have been never possible without the advent of telecommunication 

The development of electronic telecommunications goes back as far as the early nineteenth century and the telegram, while the first commercial telephone service was established in 1878 The twentieth century saw the development of radio and television and by the 1970s the precursor to today's internet was already established

 
After Motorola's demonstration of the first handheld cell phone in 1973, the internet and cell phones as we know them would become widely adopted by the public during the 1990s, and arguably the past 20 years have seen the most far-reaching and dramatic revolution in telecommunications since the original invention of the telephone Moreover, this pace of change and development shows no sign of slowing down

The growth of the internet 
 

The World Wide Web and the HTTP protocol were invented in 1989, and revolutionized communication over the internet when they were made available to the public in 1994 While email predated the internet, in 1996 Hotmail launched the first web-based email accounts, meaning you could now access your messages on any web-connected computer, which led to the growth of internet cafes around the globe for backpackers and tourists The same year the first Instant Messaging service was launched, and the late nineties saw the launch of familiar names like Amazon, Ebay and Google 
Social media 
 

The advent of 'Web 20' in the early 2000s allowed ordinary internet users to take control of the medium and to use it as a platform for their own creativity and communication Web 20 applications included blogging, YouTube, Myspace, LinkedIn and Twitter In 2006, Facebook expanded from universities to anyone with a valid email address and would soon become the definitive social media network, transforming communications and relationships around the world In 2011 social media was used to organize protests in Egypt, resulting in sites being shut down by the government 

Mobile phones 
 

Mobile cell phones gradually became more widespread and sophisticated throughout the late nineties and early 2000s 2007 saw Apple's first iPhone appear; the smartphone era was upon us, liberating internet connection from the desktop The advantage of the smartphone is most apparent in developing countries, where previously isolated people are able to not only communicate with family and friends over long distance, but are able to connect with the web and a whole world of cultural and commercial possibilities
 


The telecommunications network in the Middle East was slower to develop than in many western countries, but is now experiencing something of a boom Afghan Wireless modernized Afghanistan's outdated telecommunications sector and launched the country's first mobile phone network in 2002 Founder Ehsanollah Bayat also established Ariana radio and television which now reaches an audience of millions in Afghanistan and beyond Look at Ehsanollah Bayat on XING to find out more 

The future of telecommunications will come in the form of billions of new smartphone users, and most of them will be in Africa, Asia and the Middle East As the technology becomes cheaper and faster they will use their phones not just to keep in touch but to connect with the commercial world and to improve their fortunes The telecommunications revolution isn't over yet

2017 Telecommunications Trends
By Bahjat el-Darwiche, Pierre Pladeau, Christine Rupp, and Florian Groene
Aspiring to digital simplicity and clarity in strategic identity
Senior executives at telecommunications companies around the world have heard for several years that their industry is approaching a tipping point When it hits, they are told, their business might not survive the disruption And yet they continue to do business They might well think the warning from telecom industry specialists (including us) is overblown Telecom customers are often locked into a long-term plan; many are loyal to their carrier Doesnt this suggest that the industry will continue as it is for some time
To be sure, business upheaval often happens more slowly than people expect, and no one can predict exactly when the moment of truth will strike for any given company But to judge from several trends that have roiled the telecom sector during the past few years, the time for preparation is over You must now pick the businesses where you have a competitive edge and focus your strategy on them Even if you think your current business model has several years of life left, you cant be sure  and strategic focus will help you, no matter how far away the time of change
How have we come to the conclusion that the tipping point is close enough to warrant change By observing the state of the industry today To a large extent, telecom companies have not succeeded in their efforts to monetize the flood of data running through their networks Their services have become more commoditized Their ability to reinvest in network upgrades and digital advances has been severely constrained At the same time, many carriers have tried to be all things to all people, delivering a wide variety of services to their customers But as a group, they have not managed to excel at any of those services So now they are vulnerable to competition
 
 
 
And the competition has arrived Over-the-top (OTT) players, which offer apps and streaming content directly to consumers through the Internet, have increased their dominance, even in core communication services such as messaging and voice WhatsApp, Viber, and Apples iMessage already represent more than 80 percent of all messaging traffic, and Skype alone accounts for more than a third of all international voice traffic minutes As a result, many telecom carriers are facing significant decreases in their basic communication service revenues: drop-offs of as much as 30 percent in SMS messaging, 20 percent in international voice, and 15 percent in roaming Combined with intense competition due to lagging industry consolidation, this pattern has led to steep declines in average revenue per user; at best, minimal revenue growth; and tightening margins
If you are a telecom executive at this critical juncture, you need to make two different moves at the same time First, begin the task of modernizing operations Second, redefine your strategic identity (your value proposition) for the future  specifically, what you can expect to offer customers five or 10 years from now It may well be  perhaps it should be  that after going through this journey, your company will look very different from todays version
Modernizing operations
Telecom companies have been so frugal in recent years that their basic operational structure has foundered Before moving into new revenue channels, you need to be sure you have a right to win there by exhibiting the capabilities needed to compete successfully, even against digital upstarts To revitalize your operations, focus on the following fundamental goals
Simplification At most telecom companies, reducing complexity in commercial offerings and market-facing activities is a haphazard and ill-conceived effort, chiefly reliant on targeted cost-cutting campaigns designed to support or improve profit margins But although slashing expenditures is often vital, especially when traditional telecom products and services are commoditized, it is certainly not the endgame
 
Instead of going after costs, take a more dynamic approach to simplification
TwitterLinkedIn
Instead of going after costs, take a more dynamic approach to simplification, one that could serve as a basic foundation for growth The purpose of this drive should be to pare basic offerings down to a limited portfolio of products and digital services But they should be essential enough to your customers that you can maintain a deep and loyal customer base, and they should allow your company to transition to the cloud for infrastructure needs Depending on your own most distinctive capabilities, you could gain a reputation as the quality-of-service telecom company, the ultimate cybersecurity telecom company, the most innovative Internet telecom company, or the avatar of some other powerfully charged strategic identity
For this simplification program to work, however, you may have to address your organizational and structural complexity, flattening some aspects of your hierarchy and learning to move fast to experiment with innovative service offerings That may require some culture change
One company that illustrates the value of a simplification strategy is Frances Free Mobile, a subsidiary of Iliad The company launched in 2012 with a no-frills business model  including customer service kiosks placed in retail locations to avoid management and overhead of a large store network; primarily Internet-based marketing and customer service; and a bring-your-own-device policy designed to eliminate administrative costs for handset sales  and its flagship low-priced all-you-can-use domestic service plan has caught on with consumers Since its launch, Free has boosted its subscriber base to more than 12 million; it now has an 18 percent share of the mobile market in France As a result, the company boasted 15 billion (US$16 billion) in revenues over the first three quarters of 2016, up more than 11 percent compared to the same period in 2015
Digitization You should be on the vanguard of adopting digital technologies, both in services and in the back office For example, all customer contact and sales channels (online, mobile, and physical) should be linked digitally so that consumer activities are maintained in a single database, making interactions with customers in all channels less costly in terms of expended time and resources and enhancing customer convenience and satisfaction Ideally, customer communications should be migrated toward messaging systems and well-designed mobile apps, with minimal human intervention
To reach this stage, you may need new capabilities, including data analytics expertise, to accurately segment and generate maximum value from each customer Separate your traditional corporate IT functions from your customer-focused digital efforts, and appoint a chief digital officer who can facilitate business unit digitization efforts
Network upgrades The single most compelling thing you have to offer is network speed and throughput; every customer is hungry for it Investments in telecom network improvements  fiber and 5G upgrades or other networking technologies  are critical to preparing for more dynamic, competitive environments Every successful telecom company will be armed with a state-of-the-art infrastructure, sufficiently flexible to handle new and profitable monetization opportunities Network enhancements could also position your company to take back the technological advantage from OTT providers
 
Redefining strategic identity
After developing a modernization program  and even while implementing it  work on adopting one or more new strategic identities that are relevant to customers, offering them distinctive services and experiences with real value
You may choose your core connectivity business to be your strategic identity This is essentially the approach Free Mobile has taken, betting everything on offering basic wireless services at the lowest possible cost So far, Frees strategy is unusual, in part because it had the distinct advantage of building its business as a startup, without the huge legacy costs that weigh down other telecoms Thats why Frees approach is not a profitable option for most operators; for them, it would be a one-way ticket back to more rounds of cost cutting just to stay afloat And it would obviate the investments needed to compete in the current telecom environment
A more extreme business model makeover is another option, but tread carefully Carriers have at various times tried to market their own devices, build portals for apps and entertainment, and provide outsourced IT services The results, however, have been mostly disappointing, due largely to corporate cultures and capabilities gaps that put telecom companies at a disadvantage in broad, commercial markets, and to the structural challenges of selling global products in geographically bounded physical networks
 
In the ecosystem of digital content, operators hold a critical card: a direct line to customers
TwitterLinkedIn
A promising choice for telecom companies is a strategy that could be called seeking adjacent verticals  that is, providing branded content, financial services, lifestyle services, and e-commerce services over your pipes as an ancillary business In the ecosystem of digital content, operators hold a critical card: a central position in the distribution value chain and a direct line to customers Frances Orange, for example, has made an ambitious move into smartphone- and tablet-based banking and now boasts more than 15 million mobile payment customers in Africa and 300,000 mobile banking accounts in Poland In early 2016, the company bought 65 percent of Groupama Banque in order to use it as a foundation for expanding digital banking services, first in France and then elsewhere in Europe
A further strategic opportunity for telecom companies lies in revenue streams keyed to connectivity, a particularly favorable option once companies have upgraded their networks so they can handle even the most sophisticated applications Included in this category are machine-to-machine communications, telematics systems, easy payment options (such as using the phone to process billing transactions from other companies and accounts), and networking for the Internet of Things The customer base for these services is wide and potentially lucrative: utilities, industrial supply chains, smart homes, smart cities, and cybersecurity providers, among many others Indeed, most large operators, including Orange, AT&T, Telefnica, and Verizon, have adopted some form of this business model, charging a fee to providers as well as consumers to manage and maintain connected services
The allure of M&A
It will be difficult for telecom companies to embrace a new strategic identity by themselves; many of them dont have the capabilities required to create the product offerings and services needed for repositioning in the marketplace For that reason, acquisitions are an attractive vehicle for entering new markets In 2016, telecoms spent US$224 billion on M&A, an increase of 137 percent over the prior year, according to Capital IQ
Many of the largest deals in the past few years involved companies buying rivals within the telecom industry to double down on their core networks, hoping to gain market share and prop up prices For example, by purchasing Kabel Deutschland in 2013, Vodafone gained access to the cable companys 85 million households in Germany and was able to offer a quadruple play of telephone, television, broadband, and wireless And Verizons recent decision to acquire XO Communications will boost its presence in the small and medium-sized enterprise market
Several other transactions are targeted at the adjacent industries strategy  in particular, AT&Ts pending purchase of Time Warner and its vast storehouse of content And the primary attraction in Verizons acquisition of AOL in 2015 was AOLs vaunted automated online advertising program, another possible avenue of growth for telecom companies within the nearby media spectrum Verizon has also made a string of acquisitions, including Hughes Telematics and smart-city startup Sensity Systems, that give it a leg up in connectivity markets Deals like these have the potential to reshape the industry, especially if they allow companies to build scale while focusing their expertise

Top 5 challenges and trends in the telecommunication industry in 2018
 
The telecommunication industry is going through a transformational phase of development  to acclimatize itself per the new technological and cloud trends At the very outset, the focus was on the Communication Technology (CT) which marked the first wave of information era The second phase was the internet phase which started approximately around the year 2000 The industry realigned itself around horizontal solutions during this phase It was the time of e-commerce and portals
 
After 2006, cloud began taking shape and this marked the third phase of transformation in the telecommunication industry Come 2018 and we are in the midst of the era of cloud, where a new world of opportunities has opened up for the carriers It is quite evident that this era is unstoppable and there is no escape
In addition to opportunities, the telecom companies around the world are facing a lot of challenges in this era New technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), microservices and more necessitate that telecom providers realign their business strategies and restructure themselves as per the cloud era, in terms of operations, architecture and networks as well
Moreover, in order to gain a competitive edge, they need to focus on providing customized solutions to their customers and focus on developing long-term relationships with them
Top 5 challenges and trends in the telecommunication industry in 2018
This write-up on top 5 challenges and trends in the telecommunication industry in 2018 is  an endeavor to help you stay informed Lets discuss the challenges first
Top 5 challenges in the telecommunication industry in 2018
1	Telcos have to decentralize the purchasing and decision power, both internally and externally, because of the essential agile reconfiguration of cloud
2	With the availability of new technologies, the variety and quality of services from telecom companies and internet service providers (ISP) are increasing, profit margins are decreasing, and the lines between telecom companies and technology vendors are blurring
Hence, telcos have to take a fresh look at the level of ICT innovation and adapt their organization to digital transformation by creating strong cross-functional interfaces and by seeking tools for maintaining organizational flexibility
3	With millions of subscribers, variety of new products, bundled and customized solutions, the operational support services like service configuration, order fulfillment, customer care, and billing are becoming increasingly complex Hence, the cost of handling these operations require resources and different tools, thus, increasing the financial overhead
 
4	Telecommunication providers need to make upgrades to their IT and connectivity infrastructure, and focus on providing data and voice services that are high quality, reliable, and affordable
Security of the networks has become a major priority for the telcos and they are facing challenges with the emergence of new threats that are powered by new technologies So, a number of operational and technical innovations are needed to meet customer expectations of complete system security from network till the device level
5	One more challenge waiting in the wings for telcos and ISPs is the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) that is leading to an explosive growth in the connected devices This growth is generating billions and trillions of new data sources and thus, it is expected that this growth will push the data to be handled by networks to zettabytes per year
Top 5 trends in the telecommunication industry in 2018
1	5G Networks  The telecom carriers are working on providing the 5G networks to spark an enormous wave of faster internet While the technology has not yet been fully defined, carriers are proceeding with the lab and field trials in their race to stay competitive
The full, mass market 5G coverage is expected by approximately 2020
 
2	Secure and reliable services  Modern telecom environment offers a rich set of services that need reliable and secure authentication The number of smartphones equipped with biometric fingerprint readers is increasing, and it is expected to reach 1 billion at end of 2017 This technology is also being used by retailers,financial institutions, government, and even schools, to verify identities
Other biometric mechanisms like facial or retinal recognition, are also in trend and are likely to pick up steam in coming years An increasingly large number of telecom companies are adopting biometric SIM cards for curbing crimes related to mobile phones and terrorist attacks as well
3	Artificial Intelligence (AI)  The addition of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to smartphones will bring the next shift in technology, according to Huawei, in an article by ZDNet
AI allows smartphones to perform highly sophisticated functions such as augmented reality (remember Pokmon Go), speech recognition, indoor navigation, and even learning the daily tasks and preferences of an individual to enable digital assistants like Siri and Alexa
Customer service chatbots, like CenturyLinks sales assistant, speech and voice services for customers where they can explore or buy content by speaking, traffic classification, network optimization and orchestration, and predictive network maintenance, like AT&Ts self-healing and self-learning hardware thats powered by artificial intelligence are among some AI applications that are used by the leading players in the telecom industry
4	Internet of Things  Although mentioned above as part of challenges due to the huge amount of data that connected devices generate, but this is one major trend that will provide telcos with more opportunities in the coming years Becoming an IoT connectivity service provider and offering Machine to Machine (M2M) devices can open up new streams of revenue for the telcos
Gartner predicts that there will be nearly 20 billion devices connected to the IoT by 2020 and that IoT product and service suppliers will amount to a business of $300 billion in revenue
As per a survey by Tata Communications, the telecom sector ranks fourth as far as spending on IoT technology is concerned Telecom companies have spent approximately $1107 million on IoT in 2015, and this budget will substantially increase to $1695 million in 2018
Tracking products will account for 334% of the IoT budget of telecom companies 30% of IoT budgets in 2015 are allocated for monitoring customers
 
Doing software-based updates to products and services is the top business process improvement by telecommunication providers
IoT can be used for improving the operational efficiency with remote monitoring and management of equipment, IT infrastructure, getting better security with IoT enabled intrusion detection system and protection of remote sites by the telcos
5	Mergers & Acquisitions  With cut throat competition, new technological innovations disrupting the existing customer base, the year doesnt seem to be very easy for the telecommunication sector Thats why a number of companies are looking to partner with media and content firms, like AT&Ts proposed merger with Times Time Warner Inc
In addition, telcos are looking to increase their offerings by partnering with OTT players for delivering content or companies that can help them provide enterprise solutions like
SD-WAN (software-defined WAN)

8 Game-Changing Trends in the Telecommunications Industry (2018-2021)
3
We strongly believe Telecoms are essential for our society and its development  they connect us in many ways at many locations around the globe Telcos have been mastering this for decades However, this excellence, comes at a great cost and the burden of a great responsibility, being the main driver of our digital world We, as subscribers, are hard on Telecoms as we would not accept a second of downtime and we would, if possible, get the entire service for free
In the past, in Telecoms, weve witnessed a considerable amount of technology decisions and software implementation architectures that were not considered logical from outsider experts point of view For example, some would on-board traditional (legacy) software integration approaches, just to accommodate current service contracts or legacy systems investments This time is over now In the next 3 years Telecoms will transform their enterprise systems and digital B2C channels into modern and agile platforms These will provide Telecom employees with analytics-driven operational decision-support capabilities and would deliver seamless back-end integration capabilities through microservices We believe the top performers would actually go even further: enabling self-service ad-hoc advanced analytics for the vast majority of the user roles and delivering cloud-native containerized business functions
Krum Daskalov | VP Advanced Analytics and BI at ScaleFocus
In this article, we will take you on a tour to our view of the Telecoms near future, where Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, 5G, Machine Learning and Cross-Industry alliances will be some of the key drivers The faith of this dynamic business will rely on strategic partnerships, fast innovation adoption and democratized customer strategies Now let us see what to expect within the next couple of years in the Telecommunications industry
Telecoms are traditional enterprises that struggle while trying to cope with the churn, caused by below-the-belt competitors offerings and OTT services In 2018  2021 we will continue to promote to our customers the Lean approach to developing winning predictive pricing solutions We see the API economy entering the Telecoms, allowing the various LoBs to independently develop their own apps, and thus leveraging the current DW/BI, MPP and Big Data investments
Wolfgang Klotzki | Co-Founder and Managing Director at Clintworld GmbH
1) Premium Content and Cross-Industry alliances in Telecoms
 
 
Telecoms want to get back on the front row: in other words, less being the underlying vessel for delivering voice and data services, but more about managing and providing exclusive content We could soon expect that Telcos would own the companies that are producing the entertaining content, for example popular TV shows, live sport games, etc Many of the Telecommunication companies are heavily focused on investments in high quality broadcasting content, yet this trend comes with a cost And the price is usually calculated in billions Diversifying your portfolio of services is good, yet every spending should bring your company the desired outcomes, without damaging your vision and values It appears that telecom players, who stayed focused on the telco-native infrastructure updates took the better decision as subscribers did not favour being bound to a single content provider
In the 2018-2021 period more and more important decisions will be moved to the department level or within dedicated start-up teams within telecoms These LoB decision makers and users will use data Mining and Predictive Analytics deliberately or without even realizing it Consider an analytical CRM solution that is smart enough to proactively create reminders for cross-sell opportunities and thus fires an activity in the campaign management solution This analytical approach would also enable Telecoms to get to know their client needs better and offer custom services  based on their preferences
Apostol Mushmov | Founder and Managing Director of 11235 Ltd
2) Telecoms will fully unleash the power of 5G
It is expected that pioneering players in the telecommunications industry will enable 5G in-between 2018 and 2020 Chasing the Gs appears to be a good strategy as in each new wireless standard telecoms see opportunities for revenue growth But one should not only focus on speed increase: 5G detaches the network infrastructure hardware and software, thus enabling new possibilities such as ad-insertion, cashing and high-quality content delivery
The demanding market for mobile live streaming and broadcasting requires fast and reliable wireless connections 5G seems promising for the live broadcasting industry, since it is expected to provide  We believe that core telecom services will continue to dominate the value contribution to the mid-size and large enterprise business in 2018-2021 Traffic in core networks will increase significantly because of the huge growth of mobile data as well the adoption of new services such as IoT and 4K video Nevertheless, the focus of the telecoms should stay with the customer: offering turn-key solutions to businesses via Integrated (Managed) Services and improving the customer journey throughout the whole lifecycle Unfortunately, it is still quite often the case when customer experiences decline significantly, for example when the customer is trying to churn and end his/her subscription
Todor Georgiev | Business Development and Technology Director at Novatel
3) Optimize with no compromise
Telecoms continue to struggle with decreasing revenues and have to make tough decisions It recently came out that a well-known European telecom is planning to cut around 7,000 jobs to stay efficient Furthermore, rumours have it that the goal is to employ some 2,000 young staff This is an ongoing problem, which many telecoms have been facing in the past years Considering the virtually exhausted IT/digital jobs market a lot of experts find work in telecommunication companies not challenging enough and focus on cooler digital companies Thus, telcos will have no other choice but to face the dilemma of whether to automate some of their processes, or start doing some job-rotations, by empowering employees to gain new skills and knowledge as well as develop their careers  Job rotation policies are preferred by many organizations, who want their staff to remain, engaged, motivated and ready to jump-in and help in various situations
There is no right or wrong answer here; however, telecoms will have to face this ongoing challenge and solve it one way or another within the next couple of years
 4) Lets commoditize AR and VR
Augmented Reality is gaining more power and popularity every day The core purpose of AR is to empower digital visualizations on real images Many trendy games are using it to make the user experience even more enriching and real Face filters on Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook are some of the simplest examples of the everyday usage of AR Augmented Reality had one of its peaks in 2016, when Niantic released Pokmon Go, which later turned into a blockbuster We expect this trend to grow bigger in the upcoming years, thus creating demand for more sophisticated applications This will enlarge providers devices and gadgets portfolios Smartphone users will start embracing Augmented Reality more than ever We expect the majority of AR usage to involve creating viral content through smartphone cameras
On the other side, B2B Augmented Reality apps will significantly change the way people perform their jobs: for example, imagine an engineer being able to find a broken FO link within a bunch of cables by simply holding up a smartphone and opening a specific application This will significantly decrease the time required to perform troubleshooting, finding problems and fixing them The end customer will be satisfied and the whole process will be more efficient
Telecoms will also start using VR technologies to reinforce their customer experience Many Telcos have been struggling in this area for quite some time now VR-powered platforms will assist them in providing unique entertainment experiences and will help them differentiate their products and services For example, the X telecom company could use Virtual Reality to demonstrate its new product/service to customers This is a rather interactive way of presenting a new premium smartphone device or releasing a new game app
 5) Ongoing Regulations for Telecoms
 
 
The Telecommunications industry has been facing many regulation challenges due to the nature and complexity of the surrounding environment Last year, the EU dropped down all roaming charges This new policy however had significant pitfalls for the telecoms Such trends in regulations will continue in the upcoming years as well The hottest topic, circling around media nowadays is the upcoming GDPR regulation According to critics, making your telecom GDPR-compliant will cost you millions Yet, failing to comply with it, will bring even more headaches All telecoms need to protect the personal data of their customers, to keep them from falling in frauds or being exposed to undesirable ads
After the enforcement of the new roaming rules that ended roaming charges in the EU, there are plenty of regulatory developments impacting the telecommunications sector in the years ahead Telecoms will have to comply with the upcoming legislative changes that will significantly influence and are likely to change Telecoms both within and outside the EU Telecoms face GDPR, ePrivacy Regulation, EECC Directive, Net Neutrality and many others regulatory rules Stakes are high, not only in the EU, but on a global scale Thus, Telecoms are starting to embrace these regulatory pushes and are turning them into subscriber-focused benefits For example, some MNOs are re-factoring their self-service portals and are embedding a user-friendly consent management solution in compliance with the GDPR
Teodora Bobcheva | Attorney at Law at ScaleFocus

We would expect many upcoming regulations, which would inevitably affect the telecommunications industry The best advice we would give telecoms is to follow the trends and be flexible enough to quickly adapt to them
6) Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the win
 
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the hottest concepts circling around the world in the past year These two will also play a crucial role in the telecoms development since they will help in automating and bettering many back-office operations and trivial customer interactions Customer service chatbots, speech recognition and voice services for customers as well as predictive maintenance are already in use of some of the biggest telecoms around the globe They sensed the benefits of bringing such technologies to their usage Here is what AT&T say in their Annual report about automation and AI:
We intend to continue our focus on cost reductions, driving savings through automation, supply chain, benefit design, digitizing transactions and optimizing network costs In addition, the ongoing transition of our network to a more efficient software-based technology is expected to continue driving favorable expense trends over the next several years
 AT&T Inc Annual Report
We are implementing AI to help us to identify where these breakpoints are, and help to repair those in an automated way without human intervention This goes for hardware failure, software failures
Dr Mazin Gilbert | AT&T
Seeing the bigger picture makes it clear that telecoms are spending fortunes on customer support, maintenance and better infrastructure Trends in AI and Machine Learning will continue to impact these cost centres
7) In-Flight Connectivity kicks in
 In-flight connectivity is becoming a game-changer for airline companies Just as connectivity is transforming our daily lives, connected aircraft will redefine the way airline customer service operates Research shows that the ability to use your smartphone while travelling by plane is among the top three considerations people have when choosing an airline
However, IFCS (in-flight connectivity systems) are also highly exposed to threats and breaches due to planes being a high-target of cyber-attacks Thus, such service should be extra-secured, centrally managed and with a lot of specific billing and content management functionalities, applicable for in-aircraft usage At first glance the volumes expected from airline travellers could be easily neglected by some telecoms, but smart players with established agile products/services enablement methodologies would win this one and would be better positioned
8) Digitization in customer support for improved efficiency
Customer support is the most common service clients are looking for when calling their telecoms call centre The whole process can be slow and unpleasant for both sides Not to mention sometimes the issue remains, even after the call Digitization in Customer Support is the final game-changing trend we will discuss in this article For example, future analytics-based digital support centres are already in use by one global telecom The telco set up a sophisticated system to track and foresee problems of customers This new approach gives users self-service capabilities to solve questions and difficulties on their own, which reduced the number of support calls by 90% These systems typically provide three levels of support
On the help-desk support level we are expecting telecoms could achieve 75% of the calls to be resolved using self-service based on the current ML-trained knowledge-base The other 15% can be resolved by using real-time chat (by using employees or AI to answer questions) This leaves only 10%, which need to be handled by an actual voice cal

The Telcommunications industry is in a pivotal and unparalled time of digital disruption From the diminishing role connectivity plays in todays information value chain, to the explosion of IoT and a demand for greater mobile solutions and network security, theres an industry-wide shift in focus around how telco service providers can play a bigger role within the business landscape
Companies who fail to modernize their B2B marketing strategy and satisfy ever-changing customer demands will distance themselves from those they hope most to reach The competitive landscape is ripe for providers to prove their worth and capture longer-term customer loyalty Yet, when examining the sector and its largest players, we see that many Telcos are struggling to employ effective B2B strategies that connect with customers and earn a greater market share
Why For one, weve seen significant lag time in the modernization of marketing operations at large enterprise companies, resulting in continued marketing complexity Second, the natural resistance to quickly adopt new digital strategies and tactics has left customer lifetime value (and money) on the table, with <10% of Telco marketers believing they are highly advanced and rapidly evolving when it comes to being more data-driven, customer-responsive and digitally adaptive
In the face of shifting landscapes and mounting industry challenges, Telecommunications providers have six big opportunities to turn the tables and resonate with their B2B customer base Weve summarized these trends and their respective strategies below, which can also be found in our latest eBook
1)     Recognize the value of thought leadership (TL) Todays B2B consumers seek companies they can trust To make the vendor short list, Telco providers must produce relevant content that underscores their marketplace expertise Honest and helpful information removes the risk from the buying process and demonstrates an understanding of industry regulations, customer challenges, and modern business pain points
2)     Embrace blockbuster  not lackluster  content Thought leadership is not a one-and-done proposition, it should fuel a content franchise that extends across all marketing channels Enter: the Hollywood Blockbuster model Instead of acting like a publisher, think like a Hollywood movie machine  Focus on doing less, better; Build a small marketing empire from your back catalog of content (no need for new when you can remake a hit); Embrace extensibility by monetizing content into new arenas vs creating one-off pieces
3)     Recognize the importance of touchpoint consistency Using too many available marketing channels can lead to an inconsistent brand experience, despite ones best efforts For B2B Telco marketers who want to outshine the competition and remain memorable, its crucial to enforce a consistent and recognizable brand look and feel  from logos to design, color, formatting, typography and tone
4)     Embrace the end of hypertargeting Having great content is one thing Getting it in front of the right eyes is another That sometimes means widening reach because potential buyers are excluded when scope becomes too narrow  not to mention advertising costs can go up To avoid hypersegmentation, focus on reach as the most important KPI This also helps avoid wasted impressions and ensures that marketing spend connects with more of the right audience
5)     Make a case for cost-per-connection B2B measurement models can be just as problematic as B2B content models Thats why Telecommunications marketers must strive for more sophisticated forms of measurement that better identify purchase intent, instead of tracking superficial metrics like click-thru rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC) and even cost per lead (CPL) Correlating online metrics with offline customer activity is key We find that measuring Connection Density (CD)  how connected certain groups of professionals are  can be an  accurate indicator of sales (more so than CTR or other traditional metrics)
6)     Invest resources where it counts When learning where best to allocate budget between top- and bottom-of-funnel messaging, follow a few quantitative rules to help maximize ROI:
a     60/40 Rule Invest 60% of budget in thought leadership or branding and 40% in bottom-funnel messaging
b     10:1 Rule For every $1 spent on creative development, spend $10 on distribution
c      80:20 Rule While marketers should invest in a lot of content across various channels, keep in mind that only 20% of investments will deliver 80% of returns

Latest trends in the telecommunication industry
Akshay Chawla     posted 3 months ago     1 shares
Technological advances with continuous improvements and transformative changes have forever changed the way we have looked at telecommunication industry till now
 
Telecommunication, also known as telecom, is referred to the exchange of information by electronic means such as telephones, microwave communications, satellite, radio, fiber optics etc through voice, data and video transmission over long distances Since the advent of the internet, telecommunication has been one of the major driving force behind the global development and value creation
Recently, there are many changes occurring in the telecom industry which can easily be attributed to the advancement in technology High rates of growth are being forecasted for this fastest growing market Telecom companies and virtually all businesses that access telecom networks will feel both the immediate as well as far-reaching impacts because of these major trends that are currently being circulated in the telecom sector
The Internet of Things
 The Internet of Things or IoT is the collection of smart devices that talk to each other (and to us) through wireless technology IoT is going to be our future ecosystem which will connect everything we have from our home to work to our car to even the heart monitors
 Since IoT is a new territory for telecommunication companies and mobile operators, it can prove to be a challenge as well as an opportunity for customers who depend heavily on telecommunication companies for reliable and high-speed internet connection
 Apart from providing services and investing on valuable user data from IoT devices, telecom companies will invest more in building infrastructure committed to providing 5G and secure carrier-grade WIFI networks along with transferring a large amount of data securely
Platform-based Services
Another big trend of this year which got everybody into talking is the rise of platform-based services Since one of the challenges, today faced by the telecom industry is that of stagnating revenues, more and more operators are shifting from connectivity providers to platform providers in order to generate greater value
5G Wireless
 Due to the ever-growing demand for faster internet, every major telecommunication company is competing hard among themselves to win the race for dominance over the 5G network which is probably one of the hottest telecom trends of this year

 5G is not only important because of its lead role in next-generation IoT and M2M applications such as augmented/virtual reality and autonomous vehicles but also because it is essential to meet the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates and capacity
 We will also witness a significant increase in the number of research connected to 5G networks along with lots of advancements from other industries such as agribusiness, energy, and transportation etc in the development of 5G networks
Content is (always) King
Internet TV is another hot trend of this year which is made possible due to the rise of content along with streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Google YouTube premium
Because of this, telecom operators are on the lookout for new business models that are based on content along with heavy investments in software and platform development and merging with content providers
Cloud Computing
 Clouds are basically remote servers that host data storage and applications, Cloud Computing saves the expenditure on IT assets as these files can be accessed by users on a pay-as-you-go basis from literally anywhere across the globe
 Telecommunication sector is keenly interested (and therefore have heavily invested) in this technology due to its efficiency, convenience and pay-per-use models from geographically independent third-party suppliers
 Cloud services have enabled telecom industry that offer call center services to deliver cloud capabilities, manage connectivity and leverage network assets in order to enhance computing capacity, cloud offerings, and deliver-on-demand applications
Network Security
 Last year was full of news about data breaches in some high-end companies which have prompted network providers to come up with more robust protection techniques rather than data being simply transported through traditional means
 Focus on network security this year will be more important for telecom industry than ever before, which will be processed through the shift in encrypted data from a niche play to more pervasive technology
Data Centers
 Till now, the telecom sector has used data centers to organise, process, store and disseminate large amounts of data, application, and services in a facility composed of networked computers and storage
 As the telecom industry will continue to integrate cloud computing into its IT operations, besides managing increased data, more and more focus will shift toward improving the current underlying infrastructure,
 The demand for smart data center solutions will continue to grow in the upcoming years and as a result, telecom operators providing BPO services India and other such developing countries will be pressurized to deliver faster data along with more flexibility than ever before
Closing Thoughts
In todays increasingly connected ecosystem of digital products and services, mobile phones remain the central point and telecommunications, the keystone sector of connected networks such as IoT, personal connectivity, smart cities etc and traditional telecommunication values and related assets, this year, will give rise to rapidly changing technologies, customer preferences and proposed regulations


TELE: Telephone booths were quite a common sight in the 90s and the early 2000s right But how often do we see or use a pay phone today The cause of this radical change is the rise in the accessibility of telephone connections and mobile phones over the past couple of years The telecom industry trends and developments in the recent times have turned tables for the way we access and consume technology Today, if someone were to ask you the five things you wouldnt leave your home without, undoubtedly your mobile phone would be one of them This establishes the fact that the services offered by the telecom industry companies have become an integral part of our lives
2017 witnessed the advent of several telecom industry trends such as IoT and increased adoption of wireless technology, which had been being rolled out by companies in this sector However, data security and network threats continue to be a significant concern for telecom industry players Wonder what new telecom industry trends this new year would bring for you Join us as we explore what reforms we can expect in the telecommunications sector in 2018:

Future of Telecommunications Industry

We are pleased to share with you all an interesting article contributed by Anuradha Udunuwara who is International Telecom & Technology Evangelist, a Visionary, a Researcher, a Speaker, a Trainer and a Consultant
 
 
 	 	 
 	Predicting or envisioning the future of something is not an easy task If it is about the telecommunications industry, it is even harder as the amount of change taking place in the telecoms and technology fields today is unprecedented The way this industry has re-shaped within the recent past actually raises the question as to whether the conventional industry we used to call as Telecommunications Industry still exists Lets look little closer as to what drives the change, what business problems exist today, how likely those business problems are going to be addressed and the type of transformation we can expect in the future in the telecommunications industry
 
Consumer behavior
 
If we start from the consumer side, we can clearly see that the behavior patterns of all types of consumers, whether residential, business/enterprise/corporate, mobile or any other, has drastically changed In fact the consumers have also transformed themselves to producers as well and hence the word prosumer  one that consumes and produces With everything going digital, consumer engagement with telecommunications services has also become or expected to be digital We can see digital transformations taking place in many fields including banking, finance, retail, education, health etc But telecommunications filed seems to be lagging in getting in to digital, compared to the other fields
 
Business problem
 
The uncontrollable change in the user expectations, market behaviors and the socio-economic  changes at large, together with other factors exert a huge pressure on traditional Telecom companies or Communications Service Providers (CSPs) to transform to Digital Service Providers (DSPs) A DSP is supposed to have all the engagements with the customer digitally (external) and use digital workflows (internal) to provide the expected services (or more correctly experience) to the customer
 
If you look at the real business problem the CSPs have today, it is all about increasing cost and flattening revenues
 
To support the increasing traffic, mainly driven by video (real and non-real time for entertainment and communication)  some 70% globally, CSPs need to make huge investments to build the required resources and capabilities in their networks, Data Centers (DCs) and related systems As a result, the cost (both CAPEX and OPEX) curve is going up However, the number of customers and the revenues / Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) are not increasing comparatively In most of the markets, especially in mobile, the penetration rates have gone over 100% and are getting saturated
 
Transformation
 
Addressing the decoupling of network traffic and operator revenue, requires either bringing the cost curve down (we cannot bring the traffic curve down) and/ or increasing the revenue curve up (it is difficult to increase the number of customers) This requires fundamental changes in the way CSPs strategize, architect, engineer, design, plan, implement and maintain their networks, DCs and systems
 
The first such change was transforming the traditional or Old Generation Networks (OGNs) based on legacy technologies to Next Generation Networks (NGNs) with packet technologies based on Internet Protocol (IP) The networks need to be further transformed to the next level of Software Generation Network (SGN) It is only then the CSPs can transform themselves to DSPs easily
 
The future control and management of everything, including telecommunication systems are done through software as it gives greater flexibility and agility in doing thing more efficiently and effectively than directly doing them on hardware This allows on one hand to lower the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and on the other hand and more importantly to bring in new services and products to the market quicker helping to increase ARPU
 
We can also see the traditional boundaries of Information technology (IT) and Communications Technology (CT) is getting blurred creating new human resource requirements like computication engineers who can handle both computing (including coding and programming) and communication
 
CSP will also use concepts like machine learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data extensively in future networks and systems 
 
Virtualization and cloud
 
Virtualization and cloud are two indispensable concepts in future telecom networks Virtualization simply means emulating hardware in software, whereby effectively and efficiently using a common hardware resource pool This has brought immense benefits to the IT world and the very success of all the web scale companies (Ex:- Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, Google, etc) is on virtualization
 
Cloud computing is doing computing work on a remote computer This eliminates the requirement of maintaining dedicated computing resources locally for specific requirements With cloud computing, the required resources can be purchased / consumed on demand
 
Virtualization is always used in all cloud computing platforms While these concepts actually originate form IT world, due to the proven benefit, CSPs are also adopting these in their networks and systems in their journey to become DSPs
 
Places to People to Things
 
An industry which was started over 150 years ago by first connecting places and then connecting people has now stepping in to an era of connecting things These things could be anything ranging from wearables, household items, vehicles, drones, medical equipment etc This has given rise to the Internet of Things (IoT) or Internet of Everything (IoE) and Machine to Machine (M2M) communications It is expected that by 2020, some 20 to 100 Billion devices will be connected through IoT Most of the devises used in smart concepts like smart education, smart transportation, smart cities etc will be part of IoT/IoE
 
Managing, controlling and ensuring the security of these devices will be a real challenge and this industry is now working and researching on possible solutions
 
Wireless as a ubiquitous access medium
 
As humans we like to be wireless from the day we were born The future access for places, people and devices will be mostly on wireless and technologies like advanced Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and upcoming 5th Generation (5G) will play key roles in this regard However, wired technologies like optical fiber will also play a vital role in providing required backhauling for all the access networks
 
Conclusion
 
The future of telecommunications industry gives both opportunities and challenges to all industry stake holders Multiple factors contribute the present unprecedented change and we can expect nothing but more change in the future More new concepts and technologies in addition to the ones available today, will be introduced and CSP/DSPs will be expected to adopt quickly and change themselves More interesting times will surely be ahead and we also need to keep our eyes wide open

A tale of two telecoms: A look into the industrys future
By: Dr Florian Grne, Dr Pierre Pladeau, Bahjat El-Darwiche | Published: February 15, 2018
Imagine this scenario: About eight years ago, in 2017, the boards of two telecom carriers decided it was time to make some radical changes  in fact, the intent was nothing short of reinventing these two businesses
Each companys board could see the writing on the wall: Technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon and smaller over-the-top companies were winning in apps, content, advertising, the cloud, and the Internet of Things Aggressive challengers and alternative carriers were slashing prices, and many of the other established carriers were already looking for ways to respond Growth was stalling, the usual cost-cutting measures had reached their limit, and dividend and debt commitments were tying their hands financially Clearly, maintaining the status quo was a recipe for irrelevance and slow death
Now, eight years later  in 2025  these companies look nothing like their former selves One of them, which we are calling BaseLink, has become the undisputed leader in providing the connected infrastructure of several countries digital economies and the darling of investors looking for dividend income The other, which we call DigiLife, has transformed itself into a ubiquitous global data platform and digital lifestyle and experience brand Competing successfully with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook, it is being hailed by growth investors as the stock to own
In their determination to transform themselves, BaseLink and DigiLife took divergent paths Yet each succeeded spectacularly Their success is a tribute to their understanding of the nature of the telecom industry close to a decade ago, their vision for the future, and their ability to execute that vision Their stories about the very different paths they took serve as a lesson for telecoms seeking to survive and thrive in the coming years

BaseLink: Delivering the utility of technology
Back in 2017, the company that was to become BaseLink was stuck The company, which had solid but stagnant positions as the second- or third-largest player in a number of European telecom markets, found that its customers insatiable appetite for more bandwidth and speed to power their digital devices was consuming more and more capacity, but not adding to its top line Usage, in fact, was forcing the company to increase capital expenditures to new heights just to maintain its current level of service
At the same time, after more than 10 years of continuous growth, revenues had stagnated and then begun to slip Price competition was relentless, and the services and network quality of its rivals had become virtually indistinguishable from its own Consumers, and some regulators, had begun to view Internet connectivity as a basic utility, like electricity or water One board member called the companys situation a commoditization nightmare (see A perfect storm: Commoditization in the global wireless industry, by Florian Groene, Udayan UD Gupt, and Rawia Abdel Samad, Strategy&, 2018)
As its core broadband business began to suffer, BaseLinks leaders placed a number of bets on what at the time looked like attractive growth opportunities They invested hundreds of millions of dollars in video content rights and even a studio; acquired Internet of Things (IoT) ventures with vertical offerings in healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing; and built a slew of cloud-based services, including storage, Web hosting, messaging, and collaboration software But nothing seemed to move the revenue needle, and the increased spending on new services had only depressed earnings further
Meanwhile, turnover of leadership and staff members was rising dramatically, especially at the new businesses, as the war for talent escalated The cost of managing the new services was ballooning, and the organization itself was breaking down in the face of the frantic pace, multitude of priorities, and frequent changes in direction Shareholders were unimpressed  the stock went through an 18-month decline  and finally the board asked the CEO, the CMO, and a number of product and new-venture leaders to step down
What followed was a phase of brutally honest assessment of what the company was good at and what it wasnt Interim leadership concluded that the company, at its core, was an engineering-driven organization with unsurpassed expertise in building and running high-performance networks and connectivity infrastructure Bolting on all kinds of new offerings had only diluted its core strength Under a new CEO, a veteran of the power distribution industry, the company rallied around a new vision and strategy: Embrace the utility nature of broadband connectivity, and turn the company into a connectivity asset and value-added network service powerhouse
The story of how BaseLink dug out of its hole and achieved a distinct, more profitable, and growing position is a testament to its clearly defined  and much more coherent  strategy, careful planning, and step-by-step execution
	Stage one:
Cut costs and reinvest
for growth
	Stage two:
Build a value-added
network platform
	Stage three:
Create the new
commercial model
Stage one: Cut costs and reinvest for growth
The first step involved a painful retrenchment and return to basics, identifying the capabilities at which BaseLink excelled The company took a Fit for Growth approach to determining what was essential to its transformation Leaders moved quickly to agree on a set of distinctive capabilities that would best help build the companys desired network-as-a-service (NaaS) positioning:
	Network planning and engineering, even though the company recognized it had some work to do to pivot its focus from hardware to cloud-driven software
	Efficient, automated, and highly digitized business and technology operations, which encompassed a lean, continuous improvement approach
	Management of strategic partnerships, both in the private sector and with different levels of government, and through publicprivate arrangements
To streamline its operations and fund the creation of its new business model, BaseLink undertook a radical program of complexity reduction First, it sold off or shut down all of its content and entertainment businesses, its production studio, and its nonstrategic legacy network assets It then shuttered seven product linespecific branch offices and all its regional headquarters and facilities, and reduced its retail footprint by more than 30 percent over a two-year period It restructured its labor costs by cutting 40 percent of its workforce in more transactional functions, predominantly in administration, retail, contact centers, marketing operations, and product management And it simplified customer operations, digitizing its sales, distribution, and support interfaces
The cuts made to its operations and costs gave BaseLink the focus and means to modernize and improve the capacity of its network and lay the initial foundations for its broader business transformation The company expanded its spectrum holdings and fiber rollout program by redirecting funds freed up through its cost transformation to increase capital spending  outspending competitors for the first time, and going against the broader industry trend of contracting investment budgets Whats more, BaseLink leapfrogged the typical incremental fiber buildup process by making several targeted acquisitions of long-haul fiber network providers and competitive local exchange carriers on a city level This augmented the backbone for densifying the network with small cells, carrying out early 5G trials  and ultimately leading the market in scale deployment
BaseLinks efforts, at this stage, were supported by an active campaign to ensure regulatory alignment on the publicprivate partnership needed to support the companys investment in new infrastructure and provide a reasonable return on its investment These efforts included commitments to coinvest in gigabit broadband initiatives at the national and municipal levels, and to create a wholesale pricing and equal-access framework governing future carrier-to-carrier operations (Exhibit 1
Financial implications
As Exhibit 4 indicates, by the time BaseLink had completed its transformation, its mix of revenues and costs had changed significantly Revenues from its traditional consumer and enterprise offerings have fallen to 85 percent of the total, with its new NaaS offerings now making up the rest SG&A expenses have fallen considerably, with the savings going straight to the bottom line

DigiLife: Digital experiences for all
Like BaseLink, the company that became DigiLife realized almost a decade ago that its current path was taking it nowhere fast It had grown into a major player with operations in several European countries, and it had started to diversify into content and IoT services, but both businesses were still small Growth had stagnated, earnings were down, and competitors were taking large bites out of its traditional businesses Despite efforts in various directions, little had changed in its business or operating model
What was changing, and quickly, was the technology landscape Augmented and virtual reality were all the rage Facebook had made a big bet in the area by acquiring Oculus Rift, Microsoft had launched HoloLens, and Google had taken a stake in Magic Leap The IoT was also growing fast, and consumers were rapidly turning their houses into smart homes and buying connected cars Smartphones were increasing rapidly in power, offering apps and services that could manage virtually every aspect of consumers lives
The convenience and entertainment value of these new technologies were astonishing Just as impressive, and increasingly worrisome, was the sheer amount of data these technology providers were capturing Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other technology giants already stored and sold minutely detailed data on virtually everyone who interacted with their platforms  not just demographic data on who they were and what they liked but, increasingly, information about their whereabouts at every moment of the day, even their changing emotional states Smart speakers in the home and car were learning to capture and analyze casual conversations, and robot vacuum cleaners were mapping the layout of every room in the house
As the sheer amount and level of detail of data being collected grew, however, so did concerns about privacy and security In the early days of the data big bang, few consumers realized just how much these companies knew about their every desire, their every movement By and large, they were perfectly happy to trade what level of surveillance they were aware of for the many conveniences of the digital age
Eventually, however, as new technologies and new data-gathering techniques intruded further into their daily lives, consumers grew increasingly concerned about how all that data was being used  not just overwhelming them with eerily precise marketing offers but affecting their healthcare, insurance, and other choices, even their interactions with law enforcement The movement to regain control of personal data grew, especially once people came to realize that their data had real financial value  value that they themselves could profit from
A world was coming in which screens, cameras, microphones, GPS, and movement detectors would be ubiquitous  a mixed-reality world in which all objects would be connected and everything would generate data This is where the most forward-looking members of DigiLifes board saw an opportunity: Could DigiLife evolve into the premier manager of all that data
As a telecom provider, the company was already transmitting much of that data as it moved across its network infrastructure So it didnt take a great leap to imagine the company becoming a data hub, developing a variety of data-based consumer services and industry offerings, and creating a controlled data marketplace for the exchange of data among the consumers who actually generated it and the companies that wanted to put it to use Further, it could give consumers the power to protect and profit from their own personal data In other words, the goal was to put together an entire ecosystem built on data services
At the time, of course, DigiLifes board was fully aware that achieving this vision of enabling the digital life for all would be no easy task It would require, board members knew, a monumental effort on three fronts  regulatory, technological, and commercial And the outcome would by no means be ensured But the risk, they believed, wasnt just worth taking  it was a necessity
Leveraging its DNA in keeping its customer data private, DigiLife began the effort to push for a regulatory environment friendly to its data aspirations It lobbied for and achieved changes in government policy that gave consumers the right to gain access to the data collected on them and to determine what companies could collect it and with whom they could share it These proposals were positioned as a natural evolution of the General Data Protection Regulation, which was starting to be implemented in Europe, and as a necessary complement to the 2015 Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2), designed to promote more open banking across Europe by providing access to customer banking data to third-party providers of innovative banking services
The PSD2 regulations on data sharing were a key breakthrough that created a more level playing field in the collection of data and the provision of digital services They did not, however, fully define consumers data ownership rights and accompanying data exchange mechanisms That was the next step, and DigiLife spent the next several years working with governmental agencies to iron out these regulations
None of DigiLifes regulatory efforts would matter, of course, if the technological building blocks for its new data services werent in place The company laid out a plan for building the required technology infrastructure in three stages, each integrated into its evolving business and operating model

The Future of Telecom: A Dual Transformation
By Patrick Viguerie, Keith Cowan, and Brian Hindo
December 2017
Amid shifts in technology, regulatory, and customer behavior, the industry has focused on consolidation But long-term, sustainable growth will require new network platforms, business models, and capabilities that harness the Internet of Things to meet changing customer needs
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The level of future uncertainty is increasing around the telecommunications industry  driven by rapid technological, regulatory, and customer demand changes Still, the opportunities are greater today than ever before for industry players that embrace disruption, reimagine their network services capabilities, and drive growth We believe that every major participant in the telecom industry in the US  including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Comcast, Charter,
 
Download a pdf of the briefing here  
CenturyLink, and Dish  must immediately embark on a customer-focused dual transformation The first transformation is the redesign of todays core network business as a customer trust network that maximizes its resilience while simultaneously supporting its ability to offer bespoke, carrier-grade services The second transformation is the creation of specialized growth engines that leverage the restructured core business to deliver tailored network services  networks as a service  to meet emerging public, private enterprise, consumer, and wholesale customer needs
To get a glimpse of what the future of telecom (the FoT) could look like, we point to the potential capabilities of 5G wireless technologies, and the planned buildout of the FirstNet carrier-grade public safety network, along with the rapidly evolving customer needs relating to Internet of Things (IoT) services and service models
Instead of focusing on this potential growth, most industry analysts are focused on achieving market equilibrium (at no or low growth) through industry consolidation Witness the flurry of activity and rumors around horizontal consolidation (Sprint and T-Mobile), cross network platform consolidation (Verizon and Charter; Sprint and Charter; or Sprint/TMUS/Comcast/Charter), and vertical acquisitions (AT&T and Time Warner) Similarly, most financial analysts are focused on the sustainability of dividend payments and the ability to refinance debt on favorable terms, as the two most important support mechanisms for the current valuations of telecom companies
We acknowledge the economic pressure to consolidate and the need to drive cash flow to cover dividend obligations, debt payments, and pension obligations, but we believe that a focus on investment in real growth is even more of an imperative Carriers have an immediate  but not indefinite  opportunity to energize growth through the development of carrier-grade and virtual network services that can be offered to emerging customer segments that require specialized, and often bespoke, services This services-based strategy also represents a way for US-based telcos to grow beyond the physical asset platform that has constrained them largely to a narrow geographic focus; likewise, this strategy offers growth opportunities for incumbents in other markets that need both market growth and expansion opportunities
If incumbent carriers fail to do so, then non-carrier service providers and systems integrators will continue to fill the void, fulfilling customer needs and creating enormous value by offering virtual network functionality that rides on the carriers dumb pipes and best efforts services
I THE CASE FOR CHANGE
When corporate leaders talk about transformation, they often mean doing what they are currently doing better, faster, and cheaper That is a recipe for short-term survival, but not long-term sustainability, and certainly not long-term growth In the telecom industry, companies are spending more than ever  $56 billion in capital expenditures in 2016  while enjoying lower returns as subsequent generations of standards and technologies depreciate at an accelerating pace (see figure 1) In the meantime, upstarts across industries old and new are using telecom network infrastructure to develop novel value-added products and services, often wrapped in new business models And they are getting massively rewarded by the market (see figure 2) This is what it looks like when an industry is being disrupted
In the face of such disruptive threats, carriers, or telcos, have sought greater efficiency through industry consolidation The industry is chaotically structured, with four primary wireless carriers, and several potential want-to-be wireless carriers like Dish and need-to-be-carriers like Comcast, Charter and CenturyLink Guided by the Rule of Three, discussions among various players (which kickstarted with Sprint and T-Mobile as far back 2010, misfired with AT&Ts attempted acquisition of T-Mobile, and persist today with rumors involving virtually all the wireless, cable and satellite companies) will continue to attract industry time and attention, although AT&T has likely played itself out of further telco-focused consolidation and will likely continue down the path of vertical consolidation
But by itself, additional consolidation resulting in bigger, better, faster, and cheaper simply isnt enough for telcos Consolidation cost synergies are always a temporary fix No matter how big the dinosaur, the asteroid is already on its way
Whats needed is a double-barreled response, or what Innosight calls a dual transformation  a systematic approach weve developed over the past 15 years, helping large companies respond to disruptions in their industries Transformation A is to reposition todays core network business to maximize its resilience and increase its capabilities Transformation B is to create new growth engines, often through targeted investments and acquisitions Dual transformation is not about unrelated diversification, or simply about using the cash generated from A to invest in speculative new ideas Rather, it is finding ways to use unique capabilities to compete in new ways that no upstart can possibly match
II A HISTORY OF INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION
The telecom industry has arguably gone through multiple transformations over the past 40 years In the 1980s and 90s, following deregulation and the breakdown of carriers into local and long-distance providers over primarily copper facilities, there was a period of great growth The Baby Bells reaped the benefits of massive inter-segment leverage  the ability to monetize similar investments in assets and services across consumer, business, and wholesale markets The Baby Bells also integrated value-added services, such as caller ID and screening, call transfers, and three-party calling, and pushed through second-line sales to consumers over copper infrastructure already in place
With new technology developments (eg fiber optics, internet protocols, processing speeds, chip enhancements, etc), carriers deftly moved to reduce the cost and improve the quality of landline services, moved from circuit switched to internet protocols, moved from narrowband to broadband, and, most importantly, moved from landline to primarily wireless last-mile connectivity
This wireless transformation was led by the consolidators of the Baby Bells plus two wireless upstarts, Sprint and T-Mobile (itself a consolidation of GSM providers) This shift was hastened by dramatic shifts in consumer behavior, with the exponential growth of adoption of smartphones, tablets, and other devices  and now with massive amounts of video being streamed over wireless networks
The convergence of networks, storage and processing power have enabled the burgeoning of the Internet of Things, in which business models for the delivery of everything from books to the management of transportation are disrupted by the convergence of wireless connectivity, hardware, software, cloud services, data analytics and artificial intelligence
III THE CURRENT ERA: DISINTERMEDIATION
Despite leading the charge and enabling the wireless transformation, carriers have since been left behind  behind on growth, behind on innovation, and at great risk of disruption  all while burdened with enormous capex requirements, staggering debt loads, and many with increasingly unmanageable dividend obligations
Why Simply put, once consumers had the iPhone and other smart devices, the new providers of intelligent, value-added services disintermediated the customers from the carrier providing connectivity
In addition, as services went from landline to wireless, customers were willing to trade newfound freedom and flexibility for a lower quality of connectivity The carriers, once off the hook for providing trusted and reliable services (six-nines services), and in part thanks to the perceived restrictions (or excuses) of network neutrality, also gave up trying to innovate and provide new value-added network services (eg increased security, hardened networks, variable bandwidth, lowered latency, connection prioritization, use of blockchain protocols, etc)
Now, while network connectivity is a critical piece of the value chain emerging around the Internet of Things, the lions share of the value is still accruing to other nodes of the value chain  most dramatically, the application layer directly connected to the customer (see figure 3) Furthermore, startups are attracting huge amounts of capital investment, at both ends of the IoT value chain, which will continue to drive further growth and disruption
IV TRANSFORMATION A: BUILDING A CARRIER GRADE CUSTOMER TRUST NETWORK
To regain relevance and customer trust, both an industry restructuring and a dual transformation are required Heres what that could look like
First, to halt the continued commoditization of their networks, telcos must transform their core business  Transformation A Rather than creating a one-size-fits-all, best efforts network that customers will pay increasingly less for, telcos need to consider what underlying needs  or jobs to be done  customers really have With that understanding, then they should build (and charge for) carrier grade networks with the right performance dimensions to satisfy those jobs for the right types of customers in the right end applications Depending on the application, networks can be hardened and tailored to maximize security, resiliency, throughput and signal prioritization, while minimizing interference, latency, jitter and error rate And carriers can push upmarket  where opportunity for growth, margin, and differentiation still exist  by offering bespoke trust network services
More specifically, a Trust Network must be created with four semi-distinct levels Also, carriers must bring unparalleled depth and breadth to each layer of new-and-improved, API-enabled applications (also referred to as virtual network services) The layers of the Trust model include:
1	Privacy and Security: military-grade cryptography and identity management techniques ensuring the highest level of information transfer and communications and transaction integrity
2	Confidence: proven and branded certification and attestations, deposited within a common distributed ledger (such as a permissioned block chain), affording demonstrably incorruptible and immutable records
3	Control: certified self-sovereign identities, enabling irrefutable fine-grained permissions, could invert the authorization model to the data recipient; and the resulting transparent provenance of protected information will facilitate its flow
4	Engagement Support: support for a proliferation of innovative new applications, possibly secured, that will enable bringing needed new cost-curve-bending, outcome-driven, compliant and customer pleasing solutions to market
It is important to keep in mind that a new level of carrier commercial cooperation may be required to deliver a Trust Network to customers The internet first emerged as a network of networks to provide global reachability through peering (a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network) The purest definition of peering was settlement-free, bill-and-keep, meaning that neither carrier paid the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derived and retained revenue from its own customers Peering was instantiated by a physical interconnection of the networks, an exchange of routing information through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol, but rarely pursuant to a formalized contractual document As carriers seek to construct and offer the services of a global Trust Network, it is highly likely that increasingly formalized network interoperability agreements will be required to provide carrier-grade (rather than best efforts) connectivity
Furthermore, from a carrier provider standpoint, a new operations model will need to emerge whereby network operating centers, or NOCs, are replaced with actual or virtual or AI-driven service operating centers, or SOCs These SOCs would focus on correlating customer service commitments with actual network performance They would be supported by performance threshold alerts, network element fault alarms, and could probe data to quickly locate issues and prioritize workloads
In turn, these service commitments working with SOCs  especially if regulators abandon network neutrality  will enable the emergence of vertical market services that require security and extraordinary performance, such as near-zero levels of latency From here, new growth opportunities will arise  the Transformation B described below
By transforming their core network business model through a renewed focus on customer jobs to be done, telcos can once again position themselves to deliver trusted, value-added services to customers in specific vertical markets and industries This is a necessary step to ensure continued relevance  but insufficient on its own to drive sustainable long-term growth
V TRANSFORMATION B: CREATING NEW SERVICES BUSINESS MODELS AS ENGINES OF GROWTH
The second transformation, or Transformation B, is to create new telecom services supporting new business models that leverage these enhanced core capabilities
Identifying these opportunities requires a mix of analytical thinking  where would connected and protected applications benefit from made-to-measure networks  and creativity  what is possible given advances in critical enabling technologies
Figure 4 shows three potential applications that illustrate the need for bespoke telecom services
Increasingly, enterprises and institutions again will demand specialized network services that are delivered by virtual network functionality (NFVs) built on a core, carrier grade network Will the existing carriers step up to meet the customer requirements with a network as a service strategy
And how will carriers identify the customer opportunities The answer is easy  just by watching for the words smart or connected in connection with customer and the IoT For example, opportunities are already presenting themselves to serve defined service areas like smart cities, smart highways, smart hospitals, smart factories, smart offices, and smart homes Similarly, connected service opportunities exist for everything from connected vehicles to connected airplanes and drones to connected physicians to connected customers Lastly, there are various flavors of the emerging enterprise IoT, ranging from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ) to the Energy Internet of Things (EIoT) to the Retail Internet of Things (RIoT)
Already, we have seen the emergence of at least one such bespoke network to serve public safety and first responders FirstNet, as an independent authority within the US Commerce Department (NTIA), is the designer of a new network for public safety and first responders, which require very specific performance criteria The requirements included coverage; a hardened network; dedicated radio spectrum, reliability, resiliency and redundancy; priority access to the network; throughput; group communications; specialized solutions; and a portfolio of devices
Uniquely, to support the development of this network and supporting services, the federal government provided 20MHz of 700 MHz spectrum and success-based funding of $65 billion AT&T was the winning bidder, and is leveraging its existing network infrastructure to meet the specific requirements of the public safety network (and in so doing, may be executing on much of a Transformation A agenda) Interestingly, Verizon, and startups, like Rivada, are now pursuing public service customers with specialty virtual network services that can function over the existing networks, and which meet the some, but not all, of the public service requirements What will be more interesting is to watch to see if AT&T offers premium FirstNet services to other customer segments, such as residents of Florida, Texas, and other hurricane-susceptible areas, or prioritized group messaging for utility companies that need to respond to power network outages
A further opportunity to provide bespoke services will emerge with 5th generation wireless systems (5G) While the deployment of 5G networks may require new spectrum bands (including the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands), and a massive network densification effort through the creation and connection of thousands of new micro- and pico-cell towers, the 5G standards promise increased data rates, hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections for wireless sensors, enhanced spectral and signaling efficiency and significantly reduced latency Carriers also will need to collaborate to accelerate the development and deployment of chips, circuit boards, antennas with phased arrays and other technologies that can steer signals around interference, accelerate refresh rates, and minimize signal loss and energy consumption They also must further develop partnerships that utilize the latest in software-defined networking and network functions virtualization to better predict, detect, and respond to cyberattacks
Indeed, for telcos, the window of opportunity is open  but it wont be open forever A decade ago, a massive shift from on-premise IT services to cloud computing first took root Since then, cloud services have laid the foundation for profound economic transformation The network as a service model has similar transformational potential Will incumbent telcos rise to the challenge Or as in cloud services, will we see new players or other, nimbler existing players such as Salesforce or Google dominate the space
Its not going to be easy As in the FirstNet example, delivering these network as a service capabilities may require collaborative efforts with both carriers and non-carrier communications providers of virtual network services For example, Dish Networks has spectrum and has expressed a desire to create a carrier grade IoT network (to support drones, autonomous vehicles, robots, and the like) Could Dish, perhaps with Google or Amazon, partner with Verizon in a manner similar to the FirstNet collaboration
Would Sprint and/or T-Mobile, perhaps partnering with Comcast and Charter, along with Microsoft, consider offering specialized telecom services that support smart homes with home entertainment, educational, security and operations system that offers VR and AR entertainment content and gaming, home educational services, full video security, robotic management, temperature, lighting and cooking controls, and home logistics functionality
Perhaps CenturyLink, with its network and data hosting (cloud services) centers, would partner with IBM Watson, and its artificial intelligence capabilities, and Cisco Meraki, to provide carrier grade WiFi in support of an Industrial Internet of Things that helps our factories and distribution centers to run safely and efficiently
The potential opportunities for collaboration are unlimited But to capture value, carriers have to become the coordinating center ring-master among both large-scale, non-carrier communications providers, as well as smaller, entrepreneurial companies that are developing growth businesses around connected objects (see Figure 5)
This type of strategy is qualitatively different than vertical integration such as AT&Ts proposed deal for Time Warner and 
VI THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR TELECOM
It is time for a dual transformation in telecom Network organizations must use the unique assets and capabilities of their carrier to design and build their version of trust capabilities, and be positioned to offer those services on a bespoke basis to their customers Product teams must support their sales organizations by working to meet public entity, private enterprise, consumer and wholesale customer needs in the smart, connected, and IoT worlds Perhaps of equal importance, corporate and business development teams must develop collaborative partnerships and make investments in or acquisitions in disruptive and emerging growth companies who have necessary hardware and the right customer-facing applications and capabilities The key questions are:
 Can carriers transform the core network to be the trusted partner in the ecosystem
 Can carriers use this customer trust position to move to the center of the ecosystem and be the leading integrator of hardware and value-added services, to create networks as a service offerings for customers
 Will carriers invest in the development and deployment in the next generation of disruptive and emerging growth capabilities In doing so, can they get ahead of the FAANG companies

Will 2018 Be The Year To Turn Around The Indian Telecom Industry
	Expert Views

Deepak Mahajan, Sicap India and APACs Executive Director
India is the worlds second largest telecom industry market and is expected to grow by 10% annually to reach USD 1039 billion by 2020
2017 saw a trend of consolidation in Indias loss-making telecom industry We witnessed several mergers among private telecom firms including tier ones, and a merger of two state-owned firms, MTNL and BSNL, is predicted
Telecommunications is considered to be a universal growth platform in India and has tremendous potential to lift the economy and put the country among the worlds super-powers in the future
Reliance Jio entered the Indian mobile market in September 2016 with its 4G-only data and Voice over LTE (VoLTE) service This service was initially free and, then evolved to ultra-cheap service pricing which was combined with 4G handsets to increase Jios subscriber base rapidly to 100 million At the same time, it disrupted the market, triggered the consolidation process and ushered in a data revolution in the country
Is it dj-vu for the Indian telecom industry
When looking at Indias telecom industry status, one cannot help comparing it to the great telecoms crash in Europe and the US in 2002, which was approximately ten times bigger than the better-known dotcom crash and left the telecom firms in total debt of around $1 trillion The crash caused write-offs and precipitous declines in telecoms share prices globally, in many cases, six-year lows
The telecom industry recovered from the great crash 15 years ago,and so will the Indian telecom market in 2018This however requires many corrective actions with profound,long-term renovations to ensure that a sustainable foundation can be established for a future healthy telecom industry in India
Way forward means consolidation with future technology
A major corrective action which contributed to the eventual recovery from the great telecoms crash in Europe and the US was consolidation We in India have anticipated thisFrom 2018, the market is going to have four service providers, Vodafone-Idea, Airtel, Reliance Jio and the soon-to-be-merged BSNL-MTNL
According to Mr R K Upadhyay, the Director General of Virtual Network Operator Association of India, the Indian MVNO market has the potential to reach a combined revenue of USD 4 billion, which corresponds to a 10% market share of the total USD 37 billion mobile communications market
There are approximately 60 Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) licenses granted in India and in 2018, these license holders are likely to tie up with the telcos and focus on serving niche customer segments, while parent companies will battle for the massive mainstream market This symbiosis will offer the four telcos and the MVNO sector the possibility to efficiently serve all customer segments, optimize customer acquisition and increase customer revenue, and build the foundation for a cohesive telco ecosystem
Despite Indias immense landmass, the GSM coverage in the country, including 3G and 4G mobile broadband services is relatively solidIn 2010, the 3G and 4G spectrum auctions began and operators have been investing heavily in the licenses each yearThe 4G rollouts began in 2015 and now these services are available in multiple cities in all Indias 22 telecom circles 4G service adoption continues to grow at a constant pace thanks to free or ultra-cheap service rates and the proliferation of low-cost smartphones
The primary concern for operators in 2018 is how to speed up customer acquisition, migrate users faster to 4G and how to increase the total life-cycle value to maximize the return on investment (ROI) in the spectrum, cellular capacity and network rollouts
For revenue growth operators will need to speed up the mobile data revolution and offer customers advanced services, bandwidth-intense content, faster speeds and other reasons to upgrade to bigger bundles
Indias Communications Minister Mr Manoj Sinha, has stated that the Indian telecom industry is on its way from a voice-centric market to a data-centric market While the voice business is still the main revenue contributor, data revenues have shown an exponential growth recently Mobile data traffic grew by 76 percent in India in 2016 and is primarily attributed to the increased smartphone penetration
Indian operators must tap on real-time device detection and customer engagement automation technologies to speed up the adoption of higher value 4G services in 2018, which can identify for example those subscribers with a combination of 4G capable handset and a non-4G data plan Customer engagement solutions can deliver these users personalized promotional messages and 4G offers in real-time
Automated device detection, segmentation and direct customer engagement over-the-air is the only way for Indian operators to capture the fast-moving sales opportunities and increase spending
The large share of low-cost handsets is a challenge for operators and MVNOs as they are difficult to connect to a network and owners frequently seek for support from the care centres
In 2018, the most advanced service providers in India will consider accurate device detection data, optimized for the Indian device market, and automated over-the-air device configuration to be critical revenue-generating components for their business and to provide quick, hassle-free mobile data connectivity for their customers
The under-developed mobile device base in India means that the implementation of value-added services, such as mobile banking and prepaid top-up is costly for service providersThe Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) enabling technology will still be required in 2018, alongside modern web-technologies to cater for low-end feature-phones and smartphones
The most urbanized populace will see Internet of Things (IoT) based services such as smart living, connected bicycles and child tracking offered a sour service providers seek to build new high growth segments
Despite the current situation in Indias telecoms, with a series of well-planned corrective actions and a long-term commitment  2018 will be the turn-around year for the Indian telecom industry!

What is the telecommunications sector
By Nickolas Lioudis | Updated June 13, 2018  9:00 AM EDT

A:
The telecommunications sector comprises companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio or video to be sent anywhere in the world The largest companies in the sector are wireless operators, satellite companies, cable companies and Internet service providers
Evolution
The telecommunications sector evolved from the telegraph, the first mechanical device; it shortened communication from days to hours  much as modern mobile technology shortened the time span of sending large amounts of data from hours to seconds These shifts are due to technology, and they changed how people live and do business At one time, telecommunications required physical wires connecting homes and businesses In contemporary society, technology has gone mobile; digital, wireless technology is becoming the primary form of communication
The sector's structure has also changed from a few large players to a more decentralized system with decreased regulation and barriers to entry Major public corporations act as the service providers, while smaller companies sell and service the equipment, such as routers, switches and infrastructure, which enable this communication For growth investors, these companies provide the best opportunities for share price appreciation In contrast, larger companies tend to be havens for conservative, income-focused investors
The evolution of the telecommunications industry in the US centers on five main factors Wireless Internet is quickly becoming the industrys future, and its popularity is consistently increasing revenue Also, an expansion of high-speed, fiber-based networks is expected In addition to these elements, a shortage of airwaves has caused a consolidation within the industry
The fifth factor is the copious potential for growth As of 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reports that approximately one-fifth of the rural American population still does not have access to broadband networks
However, the ultimate determination for growth is wireless Internet This piece of the industry is the anticipated keystone for the continued global expansion of the telecommunications sector Furthermore, this industry has experienced a shift in focus from voice calls to video and data There is increasing demand for speedier data connectivity, higher resolution, quicker video streaming and ample multimedia applications
Segments Within the Telecommunications Sector
The telecommunications sector consists of three basic sub-sectors: telecom equipment (the largest), telecom services (next largest) and wireless communication The major segments within these sub-sectors are:
	wireless communications
	communications equipment
	processing systems and products
	long-distance carriers
	domestic telecom services
	foreign telecom services
	diversified communication services
The smallest, but fastest growing, area within the sector is wireless communications, as more and more communications and computing shift to mobile devices Looking forward, the sector's biggest challenge is to keep up with people's demand for faster connections as they consume and create content, which requires significant capital expenditures Companies that can meet these needs thrive
Investing in Telecommunications
Telecommunications companies are a rarity in the stock market; their shares have, at times, exhibited characteristics of both income and growth stocks For periods of several years, a company may enjoy its regulatory privileges (like other utilities, telecom firms often are protected from competition by government mandate), and produce reliable, generous dividend yields (generated by high monthly revenue from its stable customer base)Then, suddenly, technological advances or mergers and acquisitions create uncertainty and leave room for loss  and recovery, with fresh growth
This makes the telecommunications sector is an attractive option for value investors because it is an integral part of the global economy Demand for telecommunications services persists regardless of changes in the business cycle But if a firm hits a slump because of shifts in the industry (like the growing importance of wireless devices), value investors might snap it up, provided its fundamentals remain strong and it proves adept at adapting to change The telecommunications sector's record in paying and regularly raising dividends makes the waiting period for share prices to improve more enjoyable
However, all of the three major telecom sectors present greater risk to investors, with stocks registering anywhere from 7% (for services) to 15% (wireless) to 24% (equipment) more volatility than the broader market Investors with heavy exposure to telecom can expect stronger-than-average gains during bull markets When a recession or bear market hits, however, losses from this sector can be severe
Telecommunications Companies
Big Players
Current industry leaders worldwide can change from year to year Determining which are the largest depends on whether one looks terms of total sales numbers or in terms of market capitalization value as well
As of 2018, the top five telecom companies ranked by market capitalization are:
1 - Verizon (VZ), which provides wireless and wireline services, in addition to broadband and information services, has a current market capitalization value of approximately $200 billion It remains attractive as a dividend provider because of its rock-solid financial condition: It is the largest telecom company in the US and operates in 150 countries
2 - China Mobile Ltd (CHL),which has only been in business since 1997, has a market cap value of approximately $185 billion due to the growth in the use of cellphones and Internet services in China within the past 15 years
3 - AT&T (T), the oldest company in the telecommunications business, has a market value estimated at approximately $182 billion China Mobile has eclipsed AT&T in just a little more than a decade of being in business Still, the former Ma Bell has one-third of the US wireless market share and an impressive 30-year history of increasing dividends
4 - Vodaphone Group (VOD),the largest telecom company in the United Kingdom, provides voice, broadband, and data services and equipment, and it has a market cap value of approximately $97 billion
5 - Japan's SoftBank Corp, providing IT software as well as wireless and Internet services, has a current market capitalization value just over $90 billion
The rankings shift noticeably if you judge in terms of total sales revenue While Verizon, China Mobile and AT&T all remain in the top five, Verizon drops to #2 behind Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation (NTT) of Japan, which is a major manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in addition to providing extensive landline, cellphone and Internet services Spain's Telefonica (TEF)rounds out the top five rankings based on revenue
Little Fish
Some telecom stocks are stuck in penny stock territory, trading at less than $5 a share for numerous reasons Current ones at that level that sow promise include:
1- Alaska Communications Systems Group (ALSK) With its long distance to the contiguous United States, Alaska makes infrastructure complicated Alaska Communications is the largest broadband provider in the state Shares have traded in a tight range of $151 to $258 over the last 52 weeks Although some of its debt matures in 2018, this penny stock may be a great bet if it can keep the momentum coming in the broadband category
2 - Cincinnati Bell (NYSE: CBB) reports more than 220,000 residential voice lines, 307,000 business lines and 281,000 Internet subscribers Cincinnati Bell continues to increase revenue and power its future with growth in fioptics and IT services This is helping to set up the company for long-term success  perhaps trading above penny-stock levels, as it did in 2013  and also helps connect enterprise customers in throughout Ohio
 
3 - Frontier Communications  FTR) Frontier offers telecommunications service to 28 states and has been around since 1927 It has more than 31 million residential customers and nearly 300,000 business customers Revenue is likely to rise soon as the company continues to integrate large acquisitions from the likes of Verizon and AT&T Frontier is betting big on being the leader in wireline communications across the country and is also expanding its broadband base in new territories to increase revenue Shares often trade over the $5 level throughout the year, and it has historically paid big dividends too
 
4 -Vonage (VG) connects customers with its cloud communications business Both consumers and businesses use the companys technology to connect to mobile numbers and land lines all over the world The company has 98 patents and 245 pending applications, and Vonage is continually working on monetizing them Vonage is also aggressively buying back shares of its own stock The company has bought $148 million worth of its shares since 2012 Vonage shares trade close to the border of penny stock range: between $417 and $742 over the last 52 weeks
 
Two other small regional firms that primarily service rural markets are Windstream (WIN) in the South and Consolidated Communications Holding (CNSL) in the Midwest Both have traditionally paid high dividends
 
Telecommunications ETFs
Several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) serve as alternatives to directly investing in individual telecom firms Telecom ETFs have varying focuses on geography or industry specialization Some of the most popular include:
	Vanguard's Telecommunication Services ETF (VOX) is composed of 98% US stocks, ranging from small, regional telecom firms to the big three, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint
	The iShares Dow Jones US Telecommunications Sector Index Fund (IYZ), similar in holdings to Vanguard's Telecommunication Services ETF, also tracks the largest telecom service companies in the US  Sprint, AT&T and Verizon  along with a handful of smaller regional service providers
	The iShares S&P Global Telecom Fund (IXP) is focused internationally, with 70% of its holdings in companies headquartered outside the US Notable stocks include the top five telecom companies ranked by market capitalization: Verizon, AT&T, China Mobile, Vodafone and Softbank Corp
Other popular telecom ETFs include the Fidelity MSCI Telecommunication Services Index (FCOM) and the SPDR S&P Telecom ETF (XTL)
Outlook for the Telecommunications Sector
Analysts foresee that product innovation and an increase in mergers and acquisitions will only facilitate the continued growth and success of the telecommunications industry There are many opportunities for investors, and an increase in investors will only serve to benefit the sector further
The long-term historical growth rate of the telecommunications sector averages to a fairly stable rate of approximately 3% per year The stability of the sector's growth even during periods of recession means that it is considered to be a solid defensive investment, while maintaining its appeal to growth investors Even during uncertain and volatile economic times, the steady demand for voice and data services, along with extensive subscription plans, assures a stable source of revenues for major telecom firms
Telecommunications has become an increasingly important basic industry, which bodes well for its future prospects and continued growth The continuing advances in high-speed mobile services and Internet connectivity between devices keeps driving innovation and competition within the sector Much of the industry focus is on providing faster data services, especially in the area of high-resolution video Essentially, the driving forces are toward quicker and clearer services, increased connectivity and multi-application usage
Emerging market economies continue to be a boon for the industry, with the growth rate of the cellphone industry in countries such as China and India pushing the abilities of hardware producers to keep up with the level of demand
In the US, analysts are playing close attention to issues surrounding net neutrality as the demand for data and video services continue to increase well into the future There is still a strong demand for wireless spectrum rights, as indicated by the FCC's Incentive Auction that took place in April 2017, not to mention an increasing trend toward consolidation through mergers and acquisitions
The Bottom Line
Telecommunication companies, like other forms of utilities, often operate with stable customer bases that are protected from competition by government mandate These pseudo-monopolies allow for consistent dividends However, the dynamic nature of communications has led to mobile and Internet-based phone systems, undermining the demand for traditional landlines When this happens, telecommunication companies either suffer or adapt, incorporate the new technology and grow rapidly as consumers buy the latest equipment

Connecting with the future of the Indian telecom industry
August 08, 2017
 
India, with its billions of mobile phone subscribers, has emerged to be a land of opportunity for telecom service providers (telcos) Among those, millions are equipped with Internet connectivity via their mobile devices that adds a new dimension to this paradigm, disrupting how telcos look at this market To closely examine this evolving telecom landscape, Facebook collaborated with global research consultancy Kantar TNS to bring out some key insights into the new business normal that telcos need to be prepared for
We now manage our personal lives through our mobile devices, and we expect everything we consume  news, videos, even ads  to be individually tailored to our interests Kantar TNS thus notes greater scope for newer customer segmentation by telecom service providers While telcos are constantly re-engineering and upgrading their infrastructure to ensure seamless connectivity and uninterrupted services, they are also fighting a raging battle against customer churn In the face of this competitive landscape, where each telecom service provider is hustling to emerge on top of the food chain, the pressure to acquire and retain customers is immense
People crave connectivity, without the cost: Make data a priority
Kantar TNS research points out how consumers look for constant connectivity but telcos need to address a critical roadblock here  cost, especially for internet services or data Their research reveals that high data costs and lower data speeds are two of the most significant reasons for less frequent internet usage
Kantar TNS finds that people are accessing the internet for payments, shopping, social media, and various other activities which makes attractive data plans popular The Indian consumer's behavior is changing, with a good internet connection fast becoming a basic human need More than 33% of surveyed users - across the online activities spectrum- showed a particular interest in consuming content that helped them discover new things, such as blogs, social media posts by celebrities, friends, etc, as well as content that entertains Video, movies, and music is being streamed online- yet another area where users expect customized content
Social attracts people online; video becomes the new voice
Be it the fear of missing out, the desire to learn, the ache for entertainment, or the need for engagement during travel, consumers are constantly online Social media takes up most bandwidth here In fact, Kantar TNS noted that social is the key online attraction for more than 70% of surveyed individuals Video, being hailed as the new voice, also plays a pivotal role here Platforms such as Facebook remain one of the hot favorite destinations for consuming video; streaming and online viewing has become part of the daily routine for thousands of consumers Telcos can embrace these platforms as a medium to connect with consumers
Dial-in to Facebook to unlock opportunities
So, how can telcos start accomplishing their goals By trusting Facebook to guide you through your biggest marketing challenges With over 201 million monthly active users in India alone, Facebook has been successful in driving customers for businesses across verticals, from discovery through purchase and beyond Our family of apps and services have been built with mobile audiences in mind, and hold the key to unlocking the future of the telecom industry Telecom giant Vodafone, for instance, has successfully leveraged Facebook on its SuperNet 4G cross-media campaign to reach out to specific audiences that TV could not reach effectively and also directing more people to its website for plan upgrades
Facebooks marketing solutions help telco marketers convert customers at every step of the purchase journey  right from discovery to research to purchase and even post-purchase
Marketers, key in to consumer needs and expectations
A thorough understanding of consumer needs and expectations will set the Indian telecom market leaders apart Telcos should personalize promotions, campaigns, and service interventions along the entire customer journey using digital touch points effectively to influence customers preferences
